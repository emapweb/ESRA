    - Planning
    - |
      <p>
      	The planning process for the JRSOI began more than one year prior to the exercise when work began on formulating the RSOI plan and standard operations plan (SOP) by the exercise director, Paul Latham. This exercise was conducted to test and make worthwhile adjustments to that existing plan.&nbsp;The Incident Management Team (IMT) at this exercise took the plan and SOP and formulated an on-going action plan. By following accepted&nbsp;<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>National Incident Management System (NIMS) Incident Command Structure (ICS)&nbsp;protocols during their on-site planning process, the IMT Unified Commanders were able to implement the RSOI plan.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The&nbsp;IMT held initial and scheduled planning briefings, and published Incident Action Plans (IAP)&nbsp;for each operational period. All command staff meetings were conducted by the plans section chief and documented.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Concerning planning of the exercise, it was long term and accomplished with input from NC National Guard/Air Guard&nbsp;(NC NG/AG) and NC Division of Forest Resources (NC DFR) planning team members. This was a crucial factor in the success of the exercise. For future exercises of this magnitude it is recommended that at least one&nbsp;<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) discussion-based exercise such as a tabletop exercise is conducted well in advance of the full-scale exercise (FSE).<br />

      <p style="text-align: center;">
      	Lessons Learned for Planning</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Ensure a good identification (ID) card system and database are available for use at staging areas and include instructions for using the methodology in the&nbsp;SOP.&nbsp;The technology will ensure accurate, searchable unit rosters are maintained for resources processing through the RSOI and will assist with meal headcount identification.<br />
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The RSOI plan and SOP needs to allow for an increase in the number of personnel in the staging unit to handle large military units.<br />
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The simulated&nbsp;<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) assets need to be supplied with copies of the EMAC or WebEOC mission numbers and documentation as would be the case in a real event.<br />
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Order a bulk supply of ice to be delivered to the RSOI on the first day during summer months.</p>

    - Communications
    - |
      <p>
      	The JRSOI communications process worked well throughout the exercise due to exercise pre-planning, site re-con and the successful operation conducted by the Incident Management Team (IMT). The communications interoperability plans and protocols were implemented on the first day. A comprehensive communications attachment was included in each incident action plan (IAP). All available communications equipment was secured, tested, protected and sign-out sheets were completed for each item. Communications between the RSOI IMT and the State EOC was established. Some issues with the wireless internet were encountered but the NC EM information technology (IT) representative made the needed adjustments. (Even though an IT tech from the facility was covered in the contract for the event, when the need for a tech was recognized, contact could not be made.) This helped with the connectivity with WebEOC as it is the primary means of communications according the RSOI plan and SOP.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Communications equipment was distributed to the IMT Logistics Communications Unit for their control and distribution.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The NC EM area coordinator on scene was able to provide WebEOC training for IMT personnel and share his knowledge of NC EM procedures.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
      	<strong>Lessons Learned for Communcations</strong></p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Make sure there is a backup internet capability on hand in case the wireless connections fail or are overloaded with numerous personal computers (PCs). Suggest as many users as possible bring internet air cards for connectivity assurance. This should be incorporated into the RSOI plan and SOP. Also include the NC EM satellite communication (SATCOM) trailer for future exercises and real world RSOI events.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The number of two-way walkie-talkies on hand need to be increased so each IMT section is fully equipped. (The exterior control point personnel needed a two-way radio and a list of EMAC unit estimated times of arrival (ETA) at the very beginning of the check-in/inspection operation on the third day [6-22-09]. This issue was rectified by 0745.)</p>

    - Critical Resource and Distribution
    - |
      <p>
      	The acquisition and pre-staging of required supplies and equipment to support the RSOI exercise was a major undertaking. The Exercise Planning Team followed the current RSOI plan and SOP for support requirements. This included but was not limited to a forklift, one large copier, a trailer from the NC EM Badin Warehouse with cots, blankets and pallets of water and meals-ready-to-eat (MREs). Meal supply needs were coordinated with the NC Baptist Men as the number of RSOI participants was finalized.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The on-scene Critical Resource and Distribution process was conducted by the Incident&nbsp;Management Team/Unified Command. A Logistics Supply Unit was formed with a Supply Receiving &amp; Distribution Team per the RSOI SOP. A secure logistics staging area was established to provide facilities, transportation, supplies, equipment maintenance and fueling, food service, communications, and medical services.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The Incident Management Team (IMT) through the plans chief formulated plans to distribute required supplies and equipment to the various sections of the IMT and mutual aid resources. Incident Action Plans were also made for each operational period including the arrival, in-processing and demobilization of the security assets, the RSOI Force Package and the simulated EMAC assets.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Reports and various documents for the RSOI from all sections were completed and submitted to the plans section as required. This included resource tracking and finance reports for the IMT.</p>

      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
      	<strong>Lessons Learned for Critical Resource and Distribution</strong></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The RSOI IMT followed the RSOI plan and SOP as close as possible with some minor adjustments as additional supply, personnel or equipment needs were recognized.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The plan should include a refrigerated trailer and bulk ice (by the pallet) during the summer months.&nbsp;During the exercise, sufficient bags of ice were procured locally using a purchase card.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Whether real world or exercise, a delegation of purchasing authority must be given to the IMT delineating amount thresholds they are allowed to spend on a daily basis or per case basis. All other resource requests should be processed through the State EOC.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	On peak days involving large numbers of units and personnel, designate &quot;flexible space&quot; to temporarily &quot;park&quot; personnel/teams when in-processing stations are full.&nbsp; Also, increase personnel for the exterior vehicular check-in and inspection during known times that large quantities of resources are expected to arrive.</p>

    - Onsite Incident Management
    - |
      <p>
      	The Command and Control aspect of the RSOI exercise was greatly enhanced early on in the planning process because of the input of the experienced members of the NC DFR, National Guard &amp; Air Guard and NC EM. Another positive was the vast experience of the NC Baptist Men Kitchen leadership and personnel, whose leaders were included in the IMT planning process.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Upon arrival at the RSOI exercise site the NC DFR leadership established command thereby initiating and implementing the Incident Command Structure. An Incident Command Post was established in the interior of the LJMC Education Building in the southwest corner in a space well suited to the task. Transition to a Unified Command structure for the JRSOI was completed by&nbsp;combining the staffs of the NC DFR, NC NG and Air Guard with the addition of the NC EM area coordinator.&nbsp; This IMT organizational structure was formulated according to the current RSOI plan and SOP. All IMT&nbsp;sections operated according to SOP with implementation, operational requirements, resource needs and the recording of all information in the appropriate forms. Each section was able to give an on-the-spot update upon request of command staff.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The Unified Command Team conducted regular command staff meetings, operational briefings and posted all pertinent information in plain sight. The plans section chief conducted all meetings and published operational period Incident Action Plans. All informational guidance and information was briefed and posted for all participants.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The IMT unified command enforced the standards of conduct listed in Section XV of the RSOI SOP.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The incident command experience and professionalism of the NC DFR, NC EM area coordinator and the Guard assets were highly instrumental in the success of the JRSOI operation. Their conduct of the operation should be used as a model for future exercises and real world events.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The IMT public information officer (PIO) established a media holding area on the northwest side of an adjacent structure to the LJMC Education Building. This allowed for a controlled entry point for the media representatives to be brought into the site for briefings conducted by the Unified Command staff and agency leads. This is a very good idea for future exercises and events.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The IMT rotated exterior check-in and security personnel due to high heat and dehydration issues.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The IMT should ensure that enough personnel are available for exterior check-in and inspection operations when large military units are scheduled to arrive.</p>

    - |
      <p>
      	On January 4, 2011 the Program conducted a Hotwash and produced a subsequent After Action Report for the event.&nbsp; It was determined that the State EOC was severely understaffed for this event due to the extreme weather conditions (personnel could not get to the EOC) food logistics were not properly maintained, IT support was not properly maintained, communications between the SEOC and the Regional Operations and Intelligence Center was not adequate, and various other smaller logistical issues were identified.</p>

      	It became evident during this event that the personnel that staff the State Emergency Operations Center were in need of SEOC operations training and/or refresher courses.&nbsp; Due to the fact that many of our enlisted members are transferred into or out of the Emergency Management Section and Special Operations Section (the personnel that staff the SEOC) a continuous or regular SEOC training schedule needed to be implemented.&nbsp; Individuals that have limited knowledge of the SEOC or due to a lack of exposure to the SEOC were not as efficient in the operations of the SEOC as they should have been.&nbsp; Even though this event was relatively smaller in size than other events, it was quite apparent that training was needed.</p>

      <p>
      	The state&#39;s Urban Search and Rescue Team (NJ-TF1) has found during a number of real events as well as exercises (including the 2011 annual exercise in Standard, West Virginia) that while out of state, they must be self sufficient as an entity for days at a time.&nbsp; As such, the emergency purchase of fuel, equipment, lodging and food becomes an issue for the team.&nbsp; At present, the team does not have the authorization to utilize a state issued credit card for those purchases. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>

    - Cape May County Table Top Exercise Series
    - |
      <p>
      	The Cape May County Hurricane tabletop exercise was developed to evaluate Planning, Citizen Evacuation, Shelter-in-Place, and Critical Resource Logistics and Distribution capabilities. The tabletop was conducted in six modules representing the preparedness, response, and recovery phases of a category 3 hurricane impacting the Countyof Cape May.</p>
      <p>
      	While County Emergency Operations Plans are developed and approved there needs to be a mechanism to consolidate existing plans into a comprehensive intra-county plan. This would include logistical requirements and identifying the logistical shortfalls. Also identified equipment should be pre-positioned and packaged throughout the County. (ie food, water, traffic cones, etc)</p>
      <p>
      	This exercise was not as comprehensive as it could have been due to time constraints. It is recommended to continue with this series of exercises to further review the plans and address the many unresolved issues and concerns. It is further recommended that future table top exercises be presented in a one module format. &nbsp;</p>

    - |
      <p>
      	Shortfalls in resources, limits in capabilities, and conflicts in planning, were readily recognized.&nbsp; The State recognized that we must exercise the local decision-making process and identify areas needing refinements as well as identify key actions to be taken and by whom.</p>
      <p>
      	Local Resource Coordination: We must determine strengths and weaknesses in the local coordination and integration of preparedness resources. A review inter-jurisdictional mutual support compacts or agreements (between adjacent communities, interstate, and nationwide) must be completed to identify critical issues and potential solutions.</p>
      <p>
      	The development of regional contra flow plans is critical in an attempt to synchronize locally developed evacuation plans.</p>

    - Operation Flame Out - Flight 2978 Table Top Exercise
    - |
      <p>
      	Operation Flame Out tabletop exercise was developed to evaluate Planning, Communication, Intelligence and Information Sharing and Dissemination, Emergency Public Information and Warning, Mass Care, and Fatality Management. The tabletop was conducted in three modules representing the response and recovery phases of an airplane crash in the County of Bergen, New Jersey. An emphasis was placed on creating a phased response model to minimize chaos and restore critical facilities as expeditiously as possible.&nbsp; In addition, an important point addressed was that your Response Phase will shape your Recovery Phase. Participants in the exercise gained an understanding of one of the major issues facing public safety and emergency managers are the inability to communicate with one another when the need arises. Effective and efficient emergency response requires coordination, communication, and sharing of vital information among numerous public safety agencies.A continuous flow of critical information is maintained as needed among multi-jurisdictional and multidisciplinary emergency responders, command posts, agencies, and the governmental officials for the duration of the emergency response operation in compliance with National Incident Management System (NIMS). In order to accomplish that, the jurisdiction has a continuity of operations plan for public safety communications including the consideration of critical components, networks, support systems, personnel, and an appropriate level of redundant communications systems in the event of an emergency.</p>
      <p>
      	While County Emergency Operations Plans are developed and approved there needs to be a mechanism to consolidate existing plans into a comprehensive intra-county plan. This would include logistical requirements and identifying the logistical shortfalls. Identified equipment should be pre-positioned and packaged throughout the County.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Homeland security intelligence/information fusion is the overarching process of managing the development and flow of information and intelligence across all levels and sectors of government and the private sector on a continual basis. Although the primary emphasis of fusion is to identify, deter, and respond to emerging terrorism-related threats and risks, a collateral benefit to Federal, State, local, and tribal entities is that it will support ongoing efforts to address non-terrorism-related, all-hazards, all-crimes issues. Intelligence/information fusion is an ongoing, cyclical process that incorporates three primary capabilities: Information Gathering and Recognition of Indicators and Warnings; Intelligence Analysis and Production; and Intelligence and Information Sharing and Dissemination. All appropriate objectives and critical tasks will be exercised regularly at all levels in order to measure performance and demonstrate capability.</p>
      <p>
      	Both the Planning Factors for a Single Incident section and the Approaches for Large-Scale Events section have been omitted because there is no incident or large-scale event that necessarily occurs before these capabilities come in to play.</p>
      <p>
      	The Emergency Public Information and Warning capability includes public information, alert/warning and notification. It involves developing, coordinating, and disseminating information to the public, coordinating officials, and incident management and responders across all jurisdictions and disciplines effectively under all hazard conditions.</p>
      <p>
      	Fatality Management is the capability to effectively perform scene documentation; the complete</p>
      <p>
      	collection and recovery of the dead, victim&rsquo;s personal effects, and items of evidence; decontamination of remains and personal effects (if required); transportation, storage, documentation, and recovery of forensic and physical evidence; determination of the nature and extent of injury; identification of the fatalities using scientific means; certification of the cause and manner of death; processing and returning of human remains and personal effects of the victims to the legally authorized person(s) (if possible); and interaction with and provision of legal, customary, compassionate, and culturally competent required services to the families of deceased within the context of the family assistance center. All activities should be sufficiently documented for admissibility in criminal and/or civil courts. Fatality management activities also need to be incorporated in the surveillance and intelligence sharing networks, to identify</p>
      <p>
      	sentinel cases of bioterrorism and other public health threats.</p>
      <p>
      	Complete documentation and recovery of human remains and items of evidence (except in cases where the health risks posed to personnel outweigh the benefits of recovery of remains). Remains receive surface decontamination (if indicated) and, unless catastrophic circumstances dictate otherwise, are examined, identified, and released to the next-of-kin&rsquo;s funeral home with a complete certified death certificate. Reports of missing persons and ante mortem data are efficiently collected. Victims&rsquo; family members receive updated information prior to the media release. All hazardous material regulations are reviewed and any restrictions on the transportation and disposition of remains are made clear by those with the authority and responsibility to establish the standards. Law enforcement agencies are given all information needed to investigate and prosecute the case successfully. Families are provided incident specific support services.</p>

    - Operation White Out Functional Exercise 2007
    - |
      <div>
      	<p>
      		This exercise was the first exercise in the new RegionalOperationInformationCenter(ROIC). Exercise participants demonstrated an initial capability to:</p>
      	<p style="margin-left: 39.0pt;">
      		&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicate between different state agencies;</p>
      	<p style="margin-left: 39.0pt;">
      		&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Institute coordinated emergency management between agencies;</p>
      	<p style="margin-left: 39.0pt;">
      		&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utilize E-Team to increase situational awareness and resource tracking.</p>
      	<p>
      		Exercise participants completed all planned exercise objectives. Exercise participants identified several lessons learned for improvements in the ROIC/SEOC ability to respond to an incident.&nbsp; Major recommendations include:</p>
      	<ul>
      		<li>
      			Expand Incident Command System training.</li>
      		<li>
      			Improve the use of ICS principles.</li>
      		<li>
      			Conduct more frequent training in SEOC activations and operations.</li>
      	</ul>
      	<p>
      		Planners should use the results of this exercise to forecast response and incident command utilizing ROIC/SEOC assets for a natural or man-made disaster.</p>
      	<p>
      		Follow-on exercises should test specific improvements instituted as a result of this exercise and should include a focus on communications, citizen protection (evacuation and/or in place protection), critical resource logistics and distribution, emergency public information and warning, mass care, and the incident command system. Planners should consider exercises involving bordering states.</p>

      <p>
      	Not many issues were encountered for this activation as it truly became a collaborative effort for all parties involved.&nbsp; The SEOC staffing issue was addressed by incorporating a third person into the 2 person team schedule. The additional person was assigned to track resources coming in and to be a conduit or liaison to the personnel assigned to the support room.&nbsp; Periodic briefings were conducted by the SEOC Commander to coincide with the dissemination of the situation report every four hours.&nbsp; The briefing afforded SEOC Command the opportunity to give updated information on current issues for this event as well as allow each agency representative a chance to address the SEOC staff on current issues being worked on or addressed.<br />
      	<br />
      	Troopers assigned to the Emergency Preparedness Bureau were detailed to liaison with the various County OEM&rsquo;s and provide critical and timely information to the SEOC.&nbsp; Without their&nbsp; dedicated support and assistance, many of our reports or requests for information would not have been available when needed.&nbsp; Additionally, it should be noted that EPB staff provided&nbsp; enhanced SEOC Operation training to those assigned to work.<br />
      	<br />
      	The agencies assigned to the support room were truly a benefit for the SEOC Commander to have representatives to speak to regarding updated information on mass care or facilitating resource requests. The NJ Department of Human Services, working along with the Salvation Army and Red Cross, were able to provide updated information on feeding and sheltering operations ongoing throughout the state.&nbsp; The NJ Department of Human Services needs to have the Red Cross review their accounting procedures for capturing number of individuals being sheltered.&nbsp; The sheltering population is of critical importance to the SEOC and we should not have to rely on our regional Troopers to obtain this information when the Red Cross should have the updated numbers available at a moments notice and not during a limited time period throughout the day.&nbsp; Mr. William Schaffer, NJ Dept. Of Human Services, will work with the Red Cross to address this concern.<br />
      	<br />
      	Representatives of NJDMAVA were assigned to the SEOC and allowed the SEOC Commander and the Resource Unit leader to be able to address resource requests coming in for high-wheeled vehicle in a timely fashion.&nbsp; A serious gap of 12 hours occurred with the resource request from Morris County for the 5 high-wheeled vehicles to assist with evacuations. SEOC Commanders should consistently monitor all resource requests and attempt to fulfil them in a timely manner.<br />
      	<br />
      	NJDEP representatives also played a critical role for this event by providing important resources in the form of high-wheeled vehicle and 7 vessels that were either in operation or staged throughout the state if needed.&nbsp; Additionally, they were able to provide the SEOC with clarification regarding the Administrative Order signed by Commissioner Martin regarding solid waste disposal.<br />
      	<br />
      	SEOC Commanders should utilize technology to their advantage for all activations by continually displaying all resource requests on one of the screens in the operations room in order to avoid lapses as occurred for this event.<br />
      	<br />
      	Additional members of NJOEM played a critical role for this activation in making it an efficient operation and deserve recognition. Robert Kuzniacki, Logistics Coordinator of NJOEM, supplied nutritious food for all operational periods and ensured that contact numbers were provided to SEOC Command for suitable vendors to contact if additional food was needed.&nbsp; Thomas Rafferty, GIS Coordinator, worked from home and at the SEOC in order to supply river gage information, thorough weather briefing packets, and outstanding maps that were utilized by Command in order to formulate additional mission objectives for each operation period. Lastly, our IT personnel were staffed throughout this event and during each operational period in order to quickly address any computer or eteam issues that arose.<br />
      	<br />
      	It should be noted however, that one of the SEOC conference calls was not conducted properly, as per the Superintendent.&nbsp; As such, the Superintendent has requested that a procedure be developed and employed for all conference calls, which would also contain a scripted greeting, roll call and closing, in order to maintain professionalism and efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
      	The NJNG&nbsp; had pre-staged seven (7) high-water rescue vehicles (deuce and one-half) in six (6) Cape May County municipalities. The assets and staff (Guardsman) were never utilized. The NJNG may reconsider pre-staging these assets in the future unless a mission is identified.&nbsp; Instead, the assets might be more effectively staged at a local staging area while awaiting missions.</p>
      <p>
      	All NJSP, NJOEM, and allied agencies collaborated in a successful manner.&nbsp; Cape May County OEM expressed gratitude for NJOEM, NJSP, NJNG and NJDOT representation in their county EOC and for access to information via ongoing conference calls with NWS.<br />
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Communications with the SEOC were timely and accurate.&nbsp; Regional field reps reported weather information throughout the incident. Sgt. Gorman provided regular updates from the Cape May County EOC (the only county that activated their EOC and declared a state of emergency). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Consideration should be given to streamlining the information gathering requirements within the SEOC.&nbsp; SitReps contain redundant information that is already captured in ETEAM and take time away from managing the incident.&nbsp; SitReps must be completed in WordPerfect, converted into a PDF, emailed to the ROIC and captured as attachments in ETEAM. If the SEOC could copy and paste pertinent information from the ETEAM situation summary into email groups it would expedite the information gathering and managing tasks within the SEOC.</p>

    - Monster of Rock Exercise Series TTX and FNE 2007
    - |
      <p>
      	The Monster of Rock series was developed to evaluate Public Safety and Security Response, Communications, and Explosive Device Response Operations capabilities. While individual plans are developed there needs to be a mechanism to consolidate the plans into a comprehensive unified plan. This would include developing an IAP and ICS structure for each event. Also a review and understanding of the communication processes of who calls who based on a response matrix.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	There are current individual agency plans and/or procedures. &nbsp;A plan for NJSP assignments is created for each show but other agencies are not integrated into the plan. There are currently no assigned specialty unit liaisons at the venue during events.</p>
      <p>
      	Throughout the exercise, several opportunities for improvement to respond to the incident were identified.&nbsp; The primary areas for improvement, including recommendations, are as follows:</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: .75in;">
      	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Site specific and unified SOP and/or CAP and/or EOP.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: .75in;">
      	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-develop ICS structure for each event.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: .75in;">
      	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review feasibility of pre-staging specialty units/representatives and using mutual-aid with local unit resources.</p>

      	&ldquo;Things went well while ... and I were there with two exceptions; the power kept going on and off.&nbsp; We could also use additional training since we are not there too often.&rdquo;<br />
      	<br />
      	&ldquo;Succinctly, training and experience.&nbsp; Only one of the five enlisted worked/relieved us had any experience and none really knew what was going on in the EOC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of it boils down to experience because it is used so infrequently.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
      	<br />
      	&ldquo;Some of the NWS sensors aren&rsquo;t working properly ... also the Daidvisor is not on generator power.&nbsp; We had a dozen power spikes over the weekend and had to keep restarting it.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>
      	At times, SEOC personnel relied too much on E-TEAM entries without making back up telephone calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	At times, SEOC personnel reported unqualified statistics.<br />
      	<br />
      	Section Bureau Chiefs and Assistants were not notified of scheduled conference calls.<br />
      	<br />
      	Some members of the Section&rsquo;s command staff did not receive all Situation Reports generated.</p>

      <p>
      	Documentation of correction to issues emanating for exercise experience for the timely airing of the Special News Broadcast (SNB) at the 2007 Salem/Hope Creek (S/HC) and subsequent exercises again at S/HC and at Oyster Creek (OC).&nbsp; The root causes of the issues were identified in the manual provided to guide staff during an exercise or actual event.&nbsp; The manual was revised and Staff trained on the procedure.&nbsp; The initial correction of the procedures for the Public Information Staff was not encompassing enough as further issues were identified in the Command Room. &nbsp;<br />
      	<br />
      	The root cause of these issues was again identified in the Lesson Plan and training of Command Room Staff.&nbsp; The Lesson Plan was revised to ensure recipients of the SNB were identified.&nbsp; The order of faxing the SNB was also addressed in the training, procedure, and a job aid developed specifically to correct this issue.</p>

      	A root cause analysis of this issue determined the source of the issues in the Public Information Officer (PIO) procedure.&nbsp; The PIO procedure did not provide specific instructions to fax the SNB first to the EAS Station and then to the Joint Information Center and the county EOC&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>
      	Public Information personnel in the NJ SEOC should be trained to have the Special News Release developed and ready for dissemination immediately following the EAS message. They should also be trained to send the Special News Releases to the EAS station immediately following provision of the EAS message to the station. The NJ Radiological Emergency Response Plan and SOP 601 should be revised accordingly, and provided to the EAS station as well as to the State Public Information personnel.</p>

      <p>
      	REVIEW PROCESS:<br />
      	NJ-TF1 immediately recognized the need to develop a committee to review<br />
      	and recommend an improvement plan in an effort to ensure that an incident of<br />
      	this kind does not happen again. A committee of NJ-TF1 members and<br />
      	representatives from the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management<br />
      	(NJOEM), the New Jersey Division of Fire Safety (NJDFS), and the New Jersey<br />
      	Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health Administration (NJPEOSH)<br />
      	was formed to review the incident. This committee gathered pertinent information<br />
      	from photos taken during the exercise, available ICS Forms 214, and interviews<br />
      	with all personnel in the immediate area of the incident in question. An event time<br />
      	line was discussed and contributing factors were identified. From these<br />
      	contributing factors, some corrective actions were evaluated.<br />
      	OBSERVATIONS:<br />
      	Committee members have spoken with those injured and non-injured<br />
      	members that were in close proximity to the sloped floor and structural collapse<br />
      	simulator during the incident that resulted in the injury of seven team members.<br />
      	The interviews included evaluators and controller staff. Committee members<br />
      	have reviewed these statements made by witnesses, toured the scene, and<br />
      	developed a comprehensive picture of the events that took place that evening.<br />
      	Some specific incidents, items, or actions that contributed to the chain of<br />
      	events leading to the injuries to the NJ-TF1 members have been raised by the<br />
      	committee. Overwhelmingly, the committee recognized that several small errors<br />
      	combined and enhanced one another to create the scenario in which those<br />
      	seven members were sickened. The smell of gasoline inside the collapse<br />
      	simulator, from the refueling of a piece of equipment in the field, caused alarm<br />
      	with members participating in the event and elicited a certain response by<br />
      	controllers. The response by controllers was to move the positive pressure fan to<br />
      	the top of the simulator. No evidence was found that a radio communication was<br />
      	relayed between exercise staff to halt or pause the inject deployment until this<br />
      	&lsquo;Real World&rsquo; event was mitigated. As the smell of gasoline was being<br />
      	investigated, this inject (to simulate a secondary collapse) was instigated. This<br />
      	inject involved the deployment of a distraction device that created a loud crack<br />
      	outside the simulator. Secondary to the distraction device, this inject called for<br />
      	the deployment of a smoke canister. These two devices were to realistically<br />
      	simulate effects of a secondary collapse within the work area and invoke an<br />
      	evacuation response from the players. The smoke canister was deployed on the<br />
      	New Jersey Task Force 1<br />

      	(AAR/IP)<br />
      	Appendices NJ-TF1<br />
      	north side middle of the simulator, next to the observation / egress door. When<br />
      	deployed, the canister rolled into the simulator creating an unanticipated<br />
      	overabundance of smoke in the work area. Exercise controllers immediately<br />
      	made efforts to remove the canister from the simulator. This concentration of<br />
      	smoke along with the smell of gasoline within the simulator alerted workers to<br />
      	hastily evacuate the area. With dense smoke inside, members did as trained and<br />
      	followed the hoses back to the point of entry bypassing secondary egress points,<br />
      	to include the roof and north side door. The dense smoke inside was not<br />
      	mitigated expediently since the ventilation fan, moved on top, was circulating<br />
      	smoke back into the area. Once discovered, the fan was moved again.<br />
      	Controllers, distracted by moving the ventilation fan and removing the smoke<br />
      	canister, were unable to take overt actions to remove workers via alternate<br />
      	means and sites. Members were not able to don masks or respirators while at<br />
      	their work station, since they were not carrying these items on their person, while<br />
      	working in the simulated collapse scenario. There was a delay for several of the<br />
      	workers in evacuating the simulator, due to the limited ability of the Search<br />
      	Specialist to egress quickly. This was, in part, due to the physical characteristics<br />
      	of assigned equipment. A lack of lighting assisted in the immediate confusion<br />
      	surrounding the event. The exercise was constructed to have several events<br />
      	ongoing simultaneously with a maximum number of personnel involved. Due to<br />
      	the team being pushed to its capacity, the limited resources and personnel for<br />
      	peripheral duties may have contributed in some way to the accident.<br />
      	Once the working members were evacuated from the simulator, all personnel<br />
      	were accounted for, through a Personnel Accountability Report (PAR), and<br />
      	members were escorted to the Medical tent. The tent used for Medical was small<br />
      	and the decision was made to off-gas the victims outside the tent while providing<br />
      	Oxygen therapy and monitoring their symptoms. When it was determined that<br />
      	additional Medical Component personnel were needed at the scene, it became<br />
      	difficult to find them at the Base of Operations (BoO). No berthing plan was<br />
      	developed or readily available to determine the location of specific individuals in<br />
      	the sleeping area. Once patients were to be transported to local hospital facilities<br />
      	and the local EMS provider was called, there was some confusion among NJTF1<br />
      	members with regard to patient control.<br />
      	Some other noted issues are listed below:</p>

      	Once the working members were evacuated from the simulator, all personnel<br />
      	were accounted for, through a Personnel Accountability Report (PAR), and<br />
      	members were escorted to the Medical tent. The tent used for Medical was small<br />
      	and the decision was made to off-gas the victims outside the tent while providing<br />
      	Oxygen therapy and monitoring their symptoms. When it was determined that<br />
      	additional Medical Component personnel were needed at the scene, it became<br />
      	difficult to find them at the Base of Operations (BoO). No berthing plan was<br />
      	developed or readily available to determine the location of specific individuals in<br />
      	the sleeping area. Once patients were to be transported to local hospital facilities<br />
      	and the local EMS provider was called, there was some confusion among NJTF1<br />
      	members with regard to patient control.<br />
      	Some other noted issues are listed below:<br />
      	&bull; More volume of smoke than intended or expected<br />
      	&bull; Placement of inject was near a secondary egress point<br />
      	&bull; Initial and subsequent briefings did not adequately outline emergency<br />
      	procedures for &lsquo;Real World&rsquo; incidents<br />
      	&bull; The physical characteristics of the simulator&rsquo;s interior limited members&rsquo;<br />
      	ability to egress in an efficient manner *<br />
      	&bull; Weather played a small role, since there was a low ceiling causing the<br />
      	smoke to stay low.<br />
      	<br />
      	&bull; There may be no resolution, since the team trains in an ever changing<br />
      	realistic environment<br />
      	RECOMMENDATIONS:<br />
      	The committee discussed some specific changes to the exercise design that<br />
      	would have eliminated the injuries, reduced the effects of this inject on members,<br />
      	or enhanced the response to the &lsquo;Real World&rsquo; event. More communication with<br />
      	exercise participants over the entire field would have reduced anxiety by them<br />
      	and accelerated response by others. Initial and subsequent briefings should<br />
      	include emergency evacuation procedures for all involved and stress the use of<br />
      	issued equipment while in the Training Field (i.e., masks). Communicating &ldquo;We<br />
      	smell gas&rdquo; would have paused this inject until the cause was identified. A more<br />
      	comprehensive review by controllers, evaluators, exercise safety officers, and<br />
      	command staff of the inject concept, application, and intended result should be<br />
      	completed prior to its acceptance for use in the exercise. Also, more frequent and<br />
      	comprehensive briefings of controllers, evaluators, and exercise safety officers<br />
      	should be conducted, especially on the location and timing of any inject. A written<br />
      	format for suggested injects should be added to the exercise design to enhance<br />
      	creativity in the design.<br />
      	In the design of the scenario and simulator, emergency egress should be put<br />
      	at both ends, every fifty feet (50), or as required by the specific simulation.<br />
      	Although NJ-TF1 controllers usually help design and build the simulators, a walkthrough<br />
      	for those controllers and evaluators, should be conducted prior to<br />
      	engaging in any work. Any inject involving smoke should include the use of a<br />
      	better suited smoke generation system. NJ-TF1 should investigate and obtain a<br />
      	realistic, but safer alternative device. Finally, more Rapid Intervention Team (RIT)<br />
      	awareness should be put into the exercise Briefings and preparation.<br />
      	Some other ideas to enhance the exercise design are listed below:<br />
      	&bull; Medical component personnel, equipment, and dedicated transport<br />
      	should be on site during operations *<br />
      	&bull; Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) were available on Truck #5<br />
      	right behind the scenario during operations within the collapse simulator<br />
      	* Dedicated transportation may become a prohibitive cost to the team and can<br />
      	be accomplished by assigning multiple use team vehicles as needed.<br />
      	* * Some members may not have been aware that the SCBA&rsquo;s were that<br />
      	close to the incident. The RIT was not used since the members selfevacuated<br />
      	prior to any deployment of those resources.<br />
      	Finally, the committee discussed the administrative, or operational changes<br />
      	needed to reduce the possibility or effects of such an incident in the future. Since<br />
      	an exercise of this magnitude takes many months to design and prepare, there<br />
      	are several levels of verification and review prior to any scenario or inject being used by NJTF1.<br />
      	NJ-TF1 Command Staff should review, along with the selected Exercise<br />
      	Design Committee, all aspects of the exercise design. Additionally, personnel<br />
      	designated as exercise staff should be solely dedicated to the oversight, control,<br />
      	and evaluation functions of the exercise (RIT). Personnel designated as Support<br />
      	Staff should be solely dedicated to supporting all exercise functions. Support staff<br />
      	should establish and maintain strict adherence to team procedures, such as<br />
      	refueling equipment. RIT procedures should be established within the exercise<br />
      	design for each scenario. All scenarios should be designed with at least two<br />
      	emergency exits.<br />
      	Exercise participants, along with their initial briefing, should be briefed prior to<br />
      	entering the exercise site that includes potential hazards inherent to the site and<br />
      	possible hazards inherent with the approved injects and training aids. The<br />
      	briefing should also include all emergency egress points without giving away the<br />
      	scenario. NJ-TF1 members working in a collapse scenario, should be provided<br />
      	and become familiar with the use of light sticks in low light or no light situations.<br />
      	The on duty Task Force Leader (TFL) should be provided written documentation<br />
      	of upcoming injects prior to their application. Exercise staff should, without giving<br />
      	away the scenario, make sure the Medical Component has all equipment needed<br />
      	to treat possible injured members and an emergency transport plan should be<br />
      	included in the design. All training aids should be researched to reduce the risk to<br />
      	member safety.<br />
      	Exercise communications should remove the &lsquo;Real World&rsquo; terminology and<br />
      	replace with &lsquo;May-Day.&rsquo; The fire service has moved to this verbiage for<br />
      	emergency situations in everyday and exercise environments to minimize<br />
      	additional and unnecessary thought processes by those involved. The vast<br />
      	majority of NJ-TF1 membership comes from the fire community, so this change<br />
      	will enforce the existing emergency procedures. The use of a medical tent that is<br />
      	different in color or design from the rest would benefit those needing to find that<br />
      	service quickly in a large deployment area.<br />

      <p>
      	Staffing - As has been discussed in previous after action reports, the current staffing of the SEOC is not working.&nbsp; Four SEOC teams exists made up of both OEM and SOS personnel. The problem that occurs during any event is that members assigned to their respective SEOC teams are called to action by their current assignment whether that be OEM Regional duties or SOS deployment activities. Regardless, this creates a major gap in staffing of the SEOC and inevitably leaves the Team leader scrambling to find a replacement.&nbsp; Additionally, Command occasionally calls for a third person to staff the SEOC in addition to the 2-person Level 3 operational status.&nbsp; Staffing is already an issue with the current schedule and calling in a third person further exacerbates the problem.<br />
      	<br />
      	The need to address the staffing issue is critical and I understand that the Recovery Bureau has submitted a proposal of a workable solution.&nbsp; Any solution needs to draw upon a group of OEM/SOS personnel that are well-trained in EOC operations and are available to actually work in the EOC and not be deployed to other duties.&nbsp; Although this proposal may limit the amount of people that are scheduled to work in the SEOC, it will provide a group that is well-versed in the responsibilities of same.<br />
      	<br />
      	E-Team - The proper utilization of E-Team by county and municipal OEM personnel is lacking.&nbsp; The most likely reason for this is that not enough personnel are adequately trained in its use.&nbsp; An obvious solution to this problem is to have our NJOEM staff conduct E-Team training on site in various counties and municipalities that feel it would be useful. &nbsp;<br />
      	<br />
      	E-Team - An issue resulted whereby the jurisdiction Sit-Rep for the State was mistakenly deleted when&nbsp; NJDCA erroneously entered their Sit-Rep under &ldquo;State&rdquo; instead of under DCA.&nbsp; When the SEOC Ops Chief realized there were two &ldquo;State&rdquo; jurisdiction sit-reps he mistakenly hit the delete button on the wrong &ldquo;State&rdquo; sit rep causing all entries from that time to be lost.&nbsp; Luckily, all the information was captured by contacting our E-Team support cadre and they were able to provide the lost data.&nbsp; As a result of this issue, new training procedures or modifications need to take place whereby the Ops Chief is instructed NOT to utilize the delete button. Another solution to this problem would be to remove the delete feature from the Ops Chief position and just keep it with our E-team experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
      	Ocean County and the municipalities in the ten-mile Emergency Planning Zone were apprised if the issues from the exercise and suggested corrections.&nbsp; The County was advised if they intended to use an alternative means of communications compensating measures would be required to ensure all messages were received.&nbsp; The State suggested if a broadcast fax or email was utilized a roll call acknowledgment by all recipients would verify information was received.</p>

      	The Program identified the natural, technological, human-caused, and hazardous material hazards in the following documents: CCD Hazard Analysis worksheet and 2010 Denver Region Hazard Mitigation Plan, Risk Assessment, Pgs. 24-74.</p>
      <p>
      	Natural hazards identified in both the Hazard Analysis and Hazard Mitigation Plan includes: &nbsp;Drought, Earthquake, Flood, Temperature Extremes/Heat wave, Landslide, Ice Storm/Winter Storm/freezing, Severe Thunderstorm (lightening), Tornado, Wildland fire. Additional natural hazards identified in the CDC Hazard Analysis include: &nbsp;Blizzard, Dam inundation, Hurricane, Snow fall, Tidal wave, Volcano, Epidemic. Additional natural hazards identified in the Hazard Mitigation Plan include: &nbsp;Avalanche, Hail, Land subsidence.</p>
      <p>
      	Human-caused hazards identified in the CDC Hazard Analysis include three groupings:&nbsp; Human caused: &nbsp;Mass casualty (trauma), Mass casualty incident (medical/infectious), Terrorism-Biological, VIP situation, Infant abduction; Technological: &nbsp;Electrical failure, Generator failure, Transportation failure, Fuel shortage, Natural gas failure, Water failure, Sewer failure, Steam failure, Fire alarm failure, Communications failure, Medical gas failure, Medical vacuum failure, HVAC failure, Information systems failure, Fire, Hazmat exposure, Supply shortage, Structural damage; Hazardous Materials:&nbsp; Mass casualty hazmat, Small casualty hazmat, Chemical exposure, Small-medium sized spills, Large spills/releases, Terrorism-Chemical, Radiologic release, Radiologic exposure, Terrorism-Radiologic.</p>
      <p>
      	Per an interview, the Program&rsquo;s hazards are the hazards in the Hazard Analysis, but there is inconsistency in the hazards identified in the Hazard Analysis and Hazard Mitigation Plan. The Program did not document the broad range the sources for the Hazard Analysis. In Hazard Mitigation Plan, the Risk Assessment Section (Pgs. 24-74) and Appendix A (Pgs. A 1-45) does provide documentation of sources used for the natural hazards; however the risk assessment does not provide a hazard analysis of human-caused hazards.</p>
      <p>
      	The Program assessed the risk and vulnerability to people, property, and entity itself in the following documents: &nbsp;CCD Hazard Analysis worksheet and 2010 Denver Region Hazard Mitigation Plan, Risk Assessment, Pgs. 24-74. The Program did not provide a risk and vulnerability for the environment.</p>

      	&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Risk Assessments that provide the factual basis for activities proposed in the strategy portion of the mitigation plan. Statewide risk assessments must characterize and analyze natural hazards and risks to provide a statewide overview. This overview will allow the State to compare potential losses throughout the State and to determine their priorities for implementing mitigation measures under the strategy, and to prioritize jurisdictions for receiving technical and financial support in developing more detailed local risk and vulnerability assessments. The risk assessment shall include the following:&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	[i]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An overview of the type and location of all natural hazards that can affect the State, including information on previous occurrences of hazard events, as well as the probability of future hazard events, using maps where appropriate.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	[ii]&nbsp;&nbsp; An overview and analysis of the State&rsquo;s vulnerability to the hazards described in paragraph (c) (2), based on estimates provided in local risk assessments as well as the State risk assessment. The State shall describe vulnerability in terms of jurisdictions most threatened by the identified hazards, and most vulnerable to damage and loss associated with hazard events. State owned critical or operated facilities located in the identified hazard areas shall also be addressed.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	[iii]&nbsp; An overview and analysis of potential losses to the identified vulnerable structures, based on estimates provided in local risk assessments as well as the State risk assessment. The State shall estimate the potential dollar losses to State owned or operated buildings, infrastructure and critical facilities located in the identified hazard areas.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	In the context of hazard mitigation planning &ldquo;risk&rdquo; is defined as the expected future losses to a community, business or State from the effects of natural events combining the probability, severity, and vulnerability. Risk is often expressed in terms of future monetary losses because this provides a common measure that can be used to compare the effects of different hazards. &nbsp;It is important to note that risk is cumulative. &nbsp;This means that although natural hazards may not affect a place in any particular year, the probability of one or more events (in some places multiple events) occurring &ldquo;adds up&rdquo; over time. Risk calculations incorporate possible future events over a specific period. Capturing a long period allows repetitive events to be included in the risk calculation. In many cases data is <em>annualized </em>to express the chance of a hazard occurring each year.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	<strong>Probability:&nbsp; </strong>Probability is the likelihood that a hazard will impact a particular place. The ability of scientists and engineers to calculate probability varies considerably depending on the hazard in question. In many areas of the country,&nbsp;flood studies provide reasonably accurate estimates of how often water will reach particular places and elevations. On the other hand, tornados and earthquakes are nearly impossible to predict, except over very long periods of time and large areas.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	<strong>Severity:&nbsp; </strong>Severity is the measure of &ldquo;how bad&rdquo; a hazard event is. Severity is measured in various ways, depending on the hazard. For example, floods are measured in terms of depth, velocity, duration, contamination potential, debris flow, and so forth. Tornados are measured primarily in terms of wind speed, although their duration on the ground can also be an important factor in their destructiveness.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	<strong>Vulnerability:&nbsp; </strong>Vulnerability is the degree to which something is damaged by a hazard.&nbsp; These are based on studies of how buildings perform when they are exposed to hazards. Similar functions are available for infrastructure and other physical assets. Injury and mortality functions (how many people are injured or die during events) are also sometimes used as indicators of vulnerability, but these are generally not as reliable as functions for physical assets because there are many more variables.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	<strong>Value:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Value is how much it would cost to replace an asset that may be damaged or lost due to the impact of a natural hazard. &nbsp;Damage refers to physical destruction measured by physical indicators such as the number of deaths and injuries or the portions of buildings destroyed, or altered so that repair is needed. When valued in monetary terms, damages become direct losses&nbsp; There are many sources of this information, including standard cost-estimating guides (such as R.S. Means, which was used as the basis for the hurricane wind risk assessment), experience of local officials, the FEMA HAZUS (Hazards U.S.) software.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Risk calculations often start with an annualized (yearly) loss figure, which is then projected into the future for some pre-determined period (sometimes called the <em>planning horizon</em>), then <em>discounted </em>to today&rsquo;s value using a discount rate. Discounting is a standard economic methodology that is required by the Federal government for analyses of many of its programs, including FEMA&rsquo;s mitigation initiatives. It is used to account for the decreasing monetary value of events that occur far in the future, such as natural hazards. Those who are interested can read more about the required methodology as described in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-94.</p>
      <p>
      	The risk calculation techniques that were used as the basis for this plan are carefully described in the sections that follow, and conform to standard methodologies used by &nbsp;FEMA and other Federal agencies.&nbsp; As required by OMB, a discount rate of 7 percent is used in all calculations unless otherwise specified.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 71.5pt;">
      	<strong>Section 4.3&nbsp; Methodology for Identifying Statewide Hazards of Concern</strong></p>
      <p>
      	In accordance with the requirements of the Interim Final Rule (Specific reference in 4.1.1 and full copy included in Appendix B) requires that all hazards with the potential to affect New Jerseyare profiled in this section of the Plan. However, because this is a State-level hazard mitigation plan it is useful to identify the hazards that are of the most concern Statewide, so these can be the focus of more detailed assessment. It is important to note, however, that many hazards and risks are very site-specific, so as regional and local jurisdictions develop mitigation plans they should recognize that this process and the resulting table should be used only as a guide, and that more detailed and localized vulnerability and risk assessments are required for local mitigation plans.</p>

    - The State EOC needs to better communicate a common operating picture (COP)to all agencies. If a meeting or briefing ends or any activity occures that causes functional area staff to potentially lose the COP or otherwise fall behind in information flow, functional leads should conduct short briefings within their perspective area to ensure that everyone understands the period objectives and begins to forecast needs and identify and position resources accordingly. The IAP and all critical planning documents must be kept current in WebEOC and not in other locations that may not be accessible to everyone.Exercise participants experienced difficulties using WebEOC. NC should provide WebEOC training sessions or a recurring basis. NC should develop a 15-minute just-in-time training package to familarize new EOC members with the capabilities and input requirements of WebEOC,

    - Exercise participants experienced difficulties using WebEOC. Lack of interoperable communications on the NC State VIPER radio system. Communications contained acronyms that were confusing to players. New Hanover County lacked a Communications Unit Leader (COML). Radio system is needed to communicate with the Johnson County shelter. Not all computers in the State EOC functioned properly.

    - Several important aspects of briefing incoming EOC personnel were not consistently addressed. Not all individual functions at the State EOC were attended to throughout the operation period. Continuity of operations and maintaing a COP were not always considered and at time even conflicted. Essential staffing of other SERT partners and functional areas were inconsistent. State EOC personnel did not know where other agency representatives were located in the EOC.NIMS roles were not clearly defined or identified at the Harnett County Shelter. Another management layer was needed within the Operations Section at the State EOC. There appeared to be a lack of communication between the functional leads and the Operations Section Chief. The staff in the Harnett County Shelter did not have a good comfort level with situational awareness. New Hanover County uses a local version of WebEOC. The New Hanover County Public Information Officer and the EPIC did not share information. There are shortfalls in the equipment and other aspects of the State EOC's communication infrastructure, including insufficient telephone and computer availability. Although the State EOC was fully staffed and the ESFs were present the term functional lead was used on a regular basis. This tern is not consistnet with ICS. New Hanover County staff members need a location to rest and reenergize. Harnett Cuonty was unclear about where its residents would go if forced to evacuate. Johnston County Shelter needs to accommodate more backup generators. New Hanover nurses did not know which parameters to follow while at the Harnett County Shelter. New Hanover County personnel were not comfortable with sending their functionally and medically fragile population to Robeson County Community College. Local jurisdictions were not included in traffic control sessions. NC needs to develop agreements to support evacuation efforts.

    - Better coordination of mass feeding plan and sites between NC Emergency Management (NC EM) and NGOs. There was a lot of confusion as to who determines the placement and location of mass feeding kitchens between the MC task force and the regional coordination centers (RCCs). The RCCs wanted to determine the location/placement of kitchens. The Southern Baptist have pre-identified and surveyed sites that can host the large kitchens and have the other logistical resources on site (shelter facilities for workers). Baptist Men and the American Red Cross (ARC) work together with local emergency management post impact to determine the needs and locations best suited for these kitchens from the predetermined list. There was also some confusion related to the term kitchen. There are numerous sizes of kitchens that have different space requirements and operating procedures (some Baptist Men or ARC kitchens can produce up to 20,000 meals per day at a fixed site that requires a large footprint compared to a salvation army canteen that is mobile and requires a small footprint).

    - "Planners vs. Operators: As the planning process evolved, it became clear that not all of the individuals involved in the planning process would be directly involved in DNC operations. Conversely, some individuals that were tapped to be part of Branch operations during the DNC did not have a significant role in the planning process. As a result, not all of the operations staff were as familiar with the plans as they could have been\tRecommendation: Make every effort to ensure that the people participating in the planning process will also be key operational players during the event. Ensure that all operational personnel are fully briefed on planning that has been conducted."

    - "Large-Scale Planning: Much of the consequence management planning was oriented toward a major large-scale event. Some of this planning was not easily scalable to the small-scale events we actually experienced during the DNC.

Recommendation: Make every effort to train and reinforce the planning and resource-ordering framework so that stakeholders are aware of procedures that are needed to fill their requests. Establish a reserve budget within the City's coffers, or work with Federal government to facilitate an earlier grant award in the planning process."

    - "Life-safety evaluation: The DNCC did not allow DFD to conduct a life-safety evaluation of the DNC venues. A life-safety evaluation was conducted by the DNCC, but was not made available to DFD until one week prior to the start of the DNC. There was too much negotiation in the areas of occupant loading, and the process to verify occupancy numbers and overcrowding did not meet DFD requirements.  Recommendation: The Fire Department must insist upon and institute its own life-safety evaluation during the planning process. This would enable proper development of counting procedures and establish DFD as the sole authority on crowd numbers. In the planning stages, crowd control from a Fire Code standpoint must be emphasized and not negotiated."

    - "Permitting: Incorporated into the City's planning process for the DNC was the assembling of a single team consisting of representatives of agencies that issued permits necessary for the DNC. While the concept seemed fine, it proved difficult to get all agency representatives together at the same time. Permits that involved a single agency were delayed, and the person designated to receive the permit requests (background information, site plan[s], construction specifications, etc.) was not always available. This resulted in a backlog in approved permits.  Recommendation: Leave the permit process with each respective agency, and place definitive turnaround times with a reporting system with central oversight. Provide Liaisons between permit-issuers and event planners."

    - "WebEOC Protocols: OEM implemented WebEOC over a six-month period prior to the DNC. With all the other planning activities going on, this proved to be insufficient lead time to fully train all users and develop a level of familiarity with the program. While most users reported finding WebEOC easy to use from a technical standpoint, some users were less clear on the procedural side of what type of information should be entered, how entries should be formatted, etc. Respondents who had attended a WebEOC training class in generally responded more favorably than those who had not.  Recommendation: More detailed written procedures and user guidelines for WebEOC are needed. (This need was identified prior to the DNC, but was not completed prior to activation.) Future program implementations should be given more lead time prior to major events."

    - "Access To City Intranet: DFD command staff in the field were unable to access the City's intranet. Some of the tools available through the intranet would have made a more complete information and would have been nice resource to use during some decision making process. Some of these tools are traffic cameras, HRB information, staffing for the shift, access to high speed printers and documents stored on the City's server. The computer used by the DFD planning section was setup with a VPN using a Verizon air card. The information transfer was extremely slow was not practical to use.  Recommendation: Setup a minimum of two computers with VPN and high speed internet access. The computers used by Command and Plans need to be modern and need to be able support access to the City Intranet. Command and Plans also need to have access to printers and copiers that can support the work load. Tech Services works with TSS to identify 2 laptops and get access to high speed printers. All necessary software and drivers should be installed and ready for use."

As a result, they had to relocate their operation to an area remote from Fire Department command staff, resulting in an inability to communicate face-to-face. (Fire Department Line Shop personnel were able to effectively overcome the radio interference for the radio system used by the Denver Fire Department.)

For the most part, each of these tools worked well at what they were designed to do. However, the existence of several different parallel systems was sometimes confusing and duplicative.  Recommendation: It may not be feasible to eliminate or combine some systems, as each tool was designed for different purposes and different groups of users. However, better coordination between the systems would help ensure they are working in concert, rather than in conflict."

There was one distribution point at each of the venues; this distribution point was often several blocks away from the station members were assigned. However, there was some initial confusion as to whether the volunteer organization would be providing two meals per day, or two meals per 12-hour shift. Delivery times were sometimes erratic. Lastly, while the quality of most meals was acceptable, a few meals were less appetizing.  Recommendation: As generous as it was of the volunteer organizations to offer this service for our responders, the City needs to ensure that the quality, quantity, and availability of these meals are clear. Before any contracts are signed, the food size and quality should be sampled. Delivery locations and schedules need to be clearly planned in advance."

    - "Late Purchase Of Equipment: Due to uncertainties over when and if Federal funding would be approved, the City and County of Denver was initially unprepared to purchase much of the equipment and supplies needed to run an event of this magnitude. By the time Federal funding was awarded, and a funding mechanism was established, order windows were nearly past. The rush of last-minute ordering exceeded the manpower capabilities of some agencies, and also necessitated a scramble to find existing equipment that could be used if the new equipment did not arrive in time. Some equipment didn't arrive until a few days before the event, causing another rush to receive, inventory, and train with the new equipment.  Recommendation: Denver or any other city planning for future events of this magnitude should conduct a survey of existing equipment, and an assessment of what resources would be needed for the event, as soon as possible. The host city must make the commitment to properly fund needed equipment for the event up front; they cannot wait until the Federal Government makes up its mind as to when the funding or reimbursements will be released. Host cities must also take into consideration the normal processing delays associated with strict rules in their purchasing departments, and create exemptions to those rules where possible."

    - "Receiving And Tracking Of Equipment: A significant amount of work is required to receive, inventory, process, track, and distribute major equipment items. The normal resources of many City agencies were overwhelmed by the last-minute receipt of all this equipment. For example, the DFD Repair Shop was designated as the single receiving point for all Fire equipment. One mechanic was designated as equipment custodian, and wound up doing the bulk of the workload by himself under extreme time pressure.  Recommendation: Designating a single receiving location is a sensible option, and City agencies should designate such a location for all new equipment purchases. However, enough personnel and resources must be made available to that location to ensure the work gets done in time."

Also consider staging pre-screened containers containing equipment such as generators, microphone and amp system and stage materials that can then be quickly provided to a secured facility."

For example, food inspectors needed a total of five different credentials to do their jobs: a DNC photo ID badge, pre-convention credentials for the Pepsi Center, pre-convention credentials for Invesco Field, convention credentials for the Pepsi Center, and convention credentials for Invesco Field. Additionally, there seemed to be some conflict between the DNCC and USSS on what credentials were required.

    - "Vehicle Access: The delay in getting member's vehicles through security proved to be one of the bigger obstacles everyday. Because parking was provided for responders within the security zone, each member had to drive a vehicle inside the security area. Although many responders car pooled, we still had at least 30 vehicles going through security screens at every crew change. With a minimal number of security check points open, the line of vehicles was a couple blocks long. This delay caused several crews to hold over for 30 minutes before a crew change could be made. Much of the difficulty was a result of lack of a sufficient number of parking passes for each Fire Department member working the event and miscommunication of the plan between USSS command staff and USSS members working various security posts.  Recommendation: All members employed or working the convention should park off site and be bussed in. If this is not feasible, the acquisition of a sufficient number parking passes/security credentials is imperative. USSS agents working the posts should be better versed in the operational plan. Finally, the planned operational period or work schedule needs to be extended to include 30 minutes before and after each operational period to effect crew change."

This resulted in some delays and confusion issuing credentials to non-City employees, as well as entering cleared City employees into the system database. Additionally, there was some confusion over gaining access to the City and County Building itself, which was closed to the public during the convention.     Recommendation: EOC credentials should be issued to identified staff in advance of the event to minimize the demands for just-in-time credentialing."

    - "   More Venue-Specific Training Needed: Teams needed more specific training for their specialty assignments in the venues. This especially became apparent when the convention moved to INVESCO Field. Members with no or limited knowledge of the venue had uncertainty about breakout room locations and how well they would react if the worst case scenario occurred. Breakout rooms were small and uncomfortable and had limited or no access later in the week. Specialized equipment was not available for all the members on some specialty teams. The move to INVESCO was announced so late that planning, much less training, was extremely difficult.     Recommendation: Ideally, teams would be established several months prior to the event and the venue would allow several training exercises for the agencies that will be working in the venue. Training needs to be more than a review of standard operating practices and a one hour walk through of the venue. Budgeting for training should be a higher priority. Require that access is always granted to break out areas when needed to check equipment and when performing daily equipment checks. Provide reasonable and comfortable breakout rooms for the firefighters and equipment required by the NSSE and USSS."

    - "Lack Of Consistency In Assignments: Members did not always work the same assignment when working multiple shifts at the venue- and specialty companies were not utilized in specialty roles at all times. For example- a Fire Department member was assigned to EMS one day and a De-con Strike Team the next shift at the DNC. If a person was assigned to one discipline for the whole event it would created more stability in the process. When allocating the staffing for these assignments it was decided to be as fair and equitable as possible in the distribution of the considerable amount of overtime. Members were asked to sign up for DNC overtime on a \"volunteer\" basis only. Specialty team members advocated that fair and equitable should not play a role to specialty assignments.     Recommendation: Every effort was made to equitably distribute overtime hours and pay. This resulted in members getting varied assignments during the week of the convention. After the initial draft assignment roster was released- specialty team Captains were given the opportunity to adjust staffing to make sure team capability was not compromised. During off peak hours some \"specialty\" assignments were staffed with crews that made up more traditional Engine and Truck Companies due to the decreased threat during late night and early morning hours. Normal operations continued outside the NSSE site with day-to-day specialty companies fully staffed."

    - "Reassignment Of FLSH Assets: Assigning interior Strike Teams and exterior crews to Fire Prevention and crowd control activities diminished emergency response capability. After day one of the DNC it was clear that crowd control would be a major issue for the week. With the equivalent of 11 response crews dedicated to the security zone some crews were assigned to provide crowd control monitoring and dispersal duties during the heaviest activity on the convention floor.  Recommendation: Early planning scenarios involved this issue and options were discussed at length. It was important in the planning process to prevent \"two separate fire departments\"; one with the sole responsibility for response and the other for code enforcement. Response capability would be maintained when utilizing response companies for crowd control in extreme situations taking into consideration real time threat assessment factors and never dropping below an initial first alarm assignment within the Security Zone."

Escape hood equipment is not available for EOC staff. While air intakes were temporarily sealed, in the absence of an air filtration system this is a short-term solution at best.     Recommendation: The EOC needs to be able to quickly secure its air supply in the event of a chemical release. Escape hood or similar equipment needs to be available for all EOC staff. Training, PPE and PPE fit-testing must be included in an overall plan for responding to a CBRNE incident in close proximity to the EOC."

Recommendation: The command and reporting authorities for all FLSH assets needs to be clarified so that each team answers to one and only one command center."

While participation in the JIC is critical, it is equally important to have a trained Fire PIO in the field, particularly to respond to requests for media interviews.     Recommendation: During events in which the JIC will be staffed and operational, ensure adequate PIO staffing will also be available in the field. Trained personnel can be obtained from within the Department through voluntary overtime for the shifts allotted. (Replicate the procedure utilized for overtime at the Pepsi Center.) Denver Fire personnel may have to reschedule shifts to parallel that of the lead agency."

While there was unfettered access to new social media such as twitter, flickr, youtube, myspace, and facebook for the personnel responding to the convention, no specific strategy was developed to monitor such sites.     Recommendation: If social media is considered to be an important but overlooked source of information, a strategy needs to be developed for monitoring these sources. Consider what additional resources might be needed to effectively monitor social media that may be unfamiliar to PIOs. Those who are technologically savvy and regular users of new social media are likely to be most proficient at conducting effective monitoring of information online"

Additionally, changes to the program made on the fly, while helpful, created additional training challenges and were not always fully communicated to users.     Recommendation: DOEM should plan to conduct Just In Time Training on WebEOC (and EOC operations in general) during any activation to ensure that all staff are fully trained. Any changes made to the program during an event must be clearly explained to all users."

    - "   Security Of National Guard Elements: The National Guard Task Forces are not organized with stand alone security elements; this must either be provided by other National Guard forces or by civilian responders. The City of Denver and State of Colorado did not want uniformed, armed military personnel anywhere near the event. Security was a significant concern for unprotected military personnel operating adjacent to a major ingress and egress thoroughfare for protestors. The NG CER TF coordinated with Denver Police Department for perimeter security. This was then delegated to the Auraria Campus Police Department. Additionally, when concerns arose about a protest march of 4000+ persons, horse mounted officers from other supporting agencies reinforced the NG CER TF operational perimeter. Prior to occupation for the operational period, a barrier was installed around the CER TF perimeter, providing both visual and physical protection.     Recommendation: Do not assume National Guard assets provide their own security. Include detailed security plans in the initial discussions. Try to stage potentially contentious military troops remote from public areas."

A Unit Credit Card was requested back on July 29, 2010 (see attached IOC titled Proposal for USAR Unit/NJ-TF1 Credit Card). Currently the USAR Unit/NJ-TF1 is  issued Sunoco Credit Cards. Unfortunately,  this limits the Units ability to fuel its diesel and gas powered vehicles during any type of interstate travel. Two refueling situations occurred during this exercise. While at CNR, the two Units SUV's need fuel and the closest Sunoco Station was 40 miles away. While traveling to said Sunoco Station, several other gas stations (BP and Exxon) were passed. The closest being 5  miles away from CNR. This 80 mile round trip not only consumed 1 &frac12; hours travel of time but probably 5-6 gallons of gas as well.  The other refueling issue was with Truck #4 which is diesel powered. On the return trip to Lakehurst, NJ, two of the Sunoco Stations did not offer diesel fuel. This issue can be remedied with a Unit/Task Force Visa or Mastercard Credit Card as mentioned in the attached IOC."

      Further refinement of plans - that neeed to incorporate a regional approach.  There was not a regional plan for the linkage and synchronization of the current individual agency plans.  There are current agency approved evacuation plans. There is a contingency plan for the Garden State Parkwayto conduct contra-flow operations for a portion of the Parkway in Cape May/Atlantic County areas. This contingency plan is currently in the discussion phase of implementation.
      1.      Convene a regional planning team to develop a comprehensive plan that would serve as linkage and synchronization with the individual plans. This would compliment pending state legislation mandating a regional planning group.
      2.      Develop an expected timeline for trigger points, sequence of events, and tiered decision points.

    - Communications is the fundamental capability within disciplines and jurisdictions that practitioners need to perform the most routine and basic elements of their job functions. Agencies must be operable, meaning they possess sufficient wireless communications capabilities to meet their daily internal and emergency communication requirements before they focus on interoperability.  Although everyone is notifying everyone - it was not totally clear what specific agencies the tower has on their call out list besides NTSB, FAA and PANYNJ. The ROIC will be notified by numerous entities, it is not clear if these notifications are formalized in the call out protocol. The ROIC will coordinate notification of Governor, State agencies and others.  1.      The ROIC and the HCC will meet to improve coordination.  2.      NTSB has established that it is lead for the coordination of the investigation, establishing PIO, controlling the crash site and opening the FAC.  3.      Review existing Plans, Policies, and Procedures to ensure continuity of notification. Develop an integration plan between communications and notifications/call outs.

    - "The Intelligence/Information Sharing and Dissemination capability is the multi-jurisdictional, multidisciplinary exchange and dissemination of information and intelligence among the Federal, State, local, and Tribal layers of government, the private sector and citizens. The goal of sharing and dissemination is to facilitate the distribution of relevant, actionable, timely, and preferably declassified or unclassified information and/or intelligence that is updated frequently to the consumers who need it. More simply, the goal is to get the right information to the right people at the right time. An effective intelligence/information sharing and dissemination system will provide durable, reliable, and effective information exchanges (both horizontally and vertically) between those responsible for gathering information and the analysts and consumers of threat-related information. It will also allow for feedback and other necessary communications in addition to the regular flow of information and intelligence.  There was much debate over who was the lead investigatory agency and when does that authority transfer to a higher law enforcement agency. The FBI Airport Liaison Agent (ALA) will still request the manifest. You are permitted and expected to provide the FBI ALA a copy of the manifest.  1. Ensure leadership makes every effort to have discussions with the FBI ALA and the       airport police prior to an accident to discuss how the manifest will be handled in the event of an accident.  2. Establish an investigative protocol SOP outlining what units would respond to this type of incident and what the chain of command should be.   "

    - The RegionalOperationInformationCenterwas staffed prior to the start of the exercise. However there was a lack of information flow in the form of broadcast emails from ROIC Operations. It seemed that broadcast emails were only distributed when received from the Operations room. There was also a lack of integration between the ROIC and SEOC staffs. It was identified to have the SEOC SOP available to share with all agencies  New Jersey State Police coordinated the access control and entry points to the facility. The exercise provided feedback to create an emergency use access to all responding state agencies. Also the room would benefit with a few IT upgrades to facilitate an expanded use of the SEOC Support Room.  The exercise simulations cell issued limited weather updates to the ROIC. It was recommended to include more frequent updates in a future broader scope full scale exercise. The National Weather Service should also be included in any future weather related exercises.  The planning section had limited play during the scenario due to exercise time constraints. It is recommended that future exercises have extended hours as to incorporate the planning section's participation and establishment of Incident Action Plans.  The Command Section discussed the chaos and confusion that would occur during the minutes and hours immediately following a state of emergency declaration. Resource requests and tracking of resources was extremely important to the success of the exercise. More attention needs to be given to situation reporting and resource request tracking. ICS Form 211 should be utilized for all future exercises. Integration of NIMS will facilitate better resource tracking.

    - At the request of the Superintendent, modifications were made to the procedures for the Superintendent's Conference Call that are periodically conducted during SEOC activations. The procedures have changed to now have the SEOC Commander coordinate the call and adhere strictly to a script that has been written in order to maintain professionalism and efficiency on all conference calls.  It should be noted however, that one of the SEOC conference calls was not conducted properly, as per the Superintendent. As such, the Superintendent has requested that a procedure be developed and employed for all conference calls, which would also contain a scripted greeting, roll call and closing, in order to maintain professionalism and efficiency.  Representatives of NJDMAVA were assigned to the SEOC and allowed the SEOC Commander and the Resource Unit leader to be able to address resource requests coming in for high-wheeled vehicle in a timely fashion.  A serious gap of 12 hours occurred with the resource request from Morris County for the 5 high-wheeled vehicles to assist with evacuations. SEOC Commanders should consistently monitor all resource requests and attempt to fulfil them in a timely manner.  SEOC Commanders should utilize technology to their advantage for all activations by continually displaying all resource requests on one of the screens in the operations room in order to avoid lapses as occurred for this event.

    - Consideration should be given to streamlining the information gathering requirements within the SEOC.  SitReps contain redundant information that is already captured in ETEAM and take time away from managing the incident.  SitReps must be completed in WordPerfect, converted into a PDF, emailed to the ROIC and captured as attachments in ETEAM. If the SEOC could copy and paste pertinent information from the ETEAM situation summary into email groups it would expedite the information gathering and managing tasks within the SEOC.

    - Due to the fact that high ranking Division members and allied agency representatives are participating on calls-  SEOC personnel conducting conference calls must ensure that those meetings are conducted precisely on time.  All members of the Division should be addressed by their rank during conference calls- and personnel should ensure that they familiar with the participants' appropriate rank.	Conference call participants and conference call facilitators should remain cognizant of what is being said (and can be overheard)- and should not rely solely on mute buttons.     	All County EOC- County Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator- contact telephone information should be updated.    	SEOC personnel should ensure that they qualify or "double check" all reported statistical information with the appropriate state agency representative- before releasing information.   Section Bureau Chiefs and Assistants should be added to the list of conference call participants.	The Section's command staff distribution list should be updated to ensure that they receive every situation report and weather statement that is generated out of the SEOC.	SEOC personnel must ensure that the personally contact County Offices of Emergency Management to ascertain or qualify certain information such as resource requests- personnel requests and EOC activations- etc.- and should not rely solely on E-TEAM entries to assume certain activities/actions have taken place.	SEOC personnel should continue to ensure that they properly brief and offer assistance to on-coming SEOC shifts. SEOC Operations Training should be conducted for new Section members and refresher courses for all member(s) who are uncomfortable with their role(s) in EOC Operations.  ROIC Logistical personnel should continue to ensure that the ROIC generators are properly maintained/tested- to avoid power failures.	Personnel should ascertain the status/functionality of all NWS sensors and also determine how  information technology equipment that is not currently linked to generator power- can be linked to an alternate power source.    	Situation Reports should be generated for Level III Activations as well as Level IV Activations to ensure that appropriate emergency management related information is captured and conveyed to appropriate staff.

    - "The next press release number two (2) was in response to inquiries from the public concerning fishing restrictions in the Delaware Bay.  The Deputy State questioned the BNE Liaison to determine if any restrictions other than in the area closed off jointly with the State of Delaware should be imposed.  The BNE Liaison stated that there were no releases of radiation in the Bay and there should only be restrictions in the ten-mile Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ).  The Deputy State Director instructed the PIO Liaison to have a press prepared on this issue.  Press release number two (2) was sent to the ENC at 1823.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Following the Governor\xE2\x80\x99s declaration of a State of Emergency, the Chief of Staff and Deputy State Director stated, it was important to instruct the public that the Emergency Declaration was precautionary in nature.  The Deputy State Director instructed the PIO Liaison to have a press release number three (3) prepared to advised the public of the State\xE2\x80\x99s intent.  Press release number three (3) was sent to the ENC at 1851.\r\n\

      A number of calls to the OEM\xE2\x80\x99s Public Inquiry line call from Greenwich Township in Gloucester County asking if they were affected by the event at the Salem Nuclear Plant.  The Deputy State Director instructed the PIO Liaison to have a press release number four (4) prepared advising the public that the Greenwich Township in question is located in Cumberland County not Gloucester County.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The Chief of Staff suggested to the Deputy State Director that a press release expanding on the information contained in Protective Action Decision (PAD) Emergency Alert System (EAS) message.    It must be remembered that the EAS message when aired using the ENCODER to over-ride the signal of a radio station broadcasting in an automated mode is limited to two minutes.  Press release number five (5) captioned the EAS message and included the locations of the Reception Centers, and physical descriptions of the affected Emergency Response Planning Areas (ERPA\xE2\x80\x99s).  This press release did not contain a description of the evacuation routes.  Press release number five (5) was sent to the ENC at 2138.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      There was a delay in requesting the preparation of a Special News Broadcast (SNB).  The SNB is the method the State employed to amplify the two (2) minute EAS message with the ERPA descriptions, Reception Center locations, and evacuation route descriptions.  The PIO was instructed to prepare the a SNB 2050, thirty-five minutes after the original PAD.  The SNB was not aired until sent to the radio station WXKW for broadcast until 2110.  There was a delay of fifty-five minutes in providing the public with the evacuation routes, locations of the Reception Centers, and descriptions of the affected Emergency Response Planning Area\xE2\x80\x99s.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The delay in broadcasting both the SNB and press release number five (5) impeded the evacuation of the public.  An extenuating circumstance in the delay of the SNB and press release was the PAR up-grade which placed the SNB in limbo while the PAR was considered and a revised PAD message crafted and vetted through the approval process. \r\n\

      CONDITION (describe the inadequacy): There was a delay of thirty-five minutes (2050) in requesting the preparation of a Special News Broadcast (SNB) to amplify the Emergency Alert System (EAS) message resulting in its broadcast fifty-five minutes (2110) after the Protective Action decision (2015).
      
      POSSIBLE CAUSE (what is responsible): The Command Room Staff may have been unaware that the EAS station was on automated mode and thus capable of broadcasting only a two minute message.  They may also have been unaware that the SNB must follow as soon as possible to address the shortcomings of the EAS message.  The delay in broadcasting both the SNB and press release number five (5) impeded the evacuation of the public.  An extenuating circumstance in the delay of the SNB and press release was the PAR up-grade which placed the SNB in limbo while the PAR was considered and a revised PAD message crafted and vetted through the approval process.

      Broadcast of protective action implementation to the public was not timely. Forty (40) minutes elapsed between broadcast of the second EAS message and the associated Special News Release. The EAS message stated that listeners should stay tuned for detailed information for the public on carrying out protective action decisions, including geographic descriptions of the affected Emergency Response Planning Areas (ERPAs), Reception Centers and evacuation routes to take to the Reception Centers. Additionally, the Extent-of-Play agreement indicates that the EAS Special News Releases were to be provided to the primary EAS Station, as well as the Joint Information Center (JIC).  
      The sequence of events began at 1953hrs when the EAS station operator simulated broadcasting EAS message #2 over the EAS system. He repeated the message every 15 minutes thereafter. At 2007hrs, a fax was retrieved from the NJ SEOC that was a duplicate of the EAS message #2, not the Special News Release that was expected. Two phone calls to the NJ SEOC were made by the controller. The controller was told at first that the duplicate fax had been sent because the radio station had previously experienced difficulties with one of the two fax machines at the station. Subsequently, the controller was told that the station would not get the Special News Release; it would be disseminated from the JIC despite the statement in EAS message #2 that listeners should expect additional detailed information on actions they should take to be broadcast from the station over the EAS.
      At 2027hrs, a heads-up ring-down phone call was received by the station from the NJ SEOC to check the fax machine. They had sent a copy of the Special News Release related to EAS #2 containing protective action implementation instructions for the public. At 2033hrs, forty minutes after the initial broadcast of EAS message #2, as well as two subsequent repetitions of the EAS message, the operator read EAS message #2 a fourth time and then read the six page Special News Release. This does not constitute timely notification of the public.
       Confusion in the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) as to how Special News Releases containing vital information for the public is to be coordinated and disseminated.

      The Special News Release to EAS message #2, which indicated that the public should stay tuned for important protective action information, did not get broadcast until 40 minutes after the first dissemination of the EAS message #2. Therefore the public was not notified of vital protective actions, including information on how to shelter-in-place, prepare to evacuate and , if evacuating, where to go in a timely manner, thus potentially endangering the health and safety of the public. 
                  
      The Special News Release repeated information from the EAS message on which ERPAs to evacuate (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 17) and which ERPAs should shelter-in-place (5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16). Not only were geographical descriptions of the ERPAs given, but also the locations of the Reception Centers and the appropriate evacuation routes to take to get to them. Persons without vehicles were instructed to either travel with neighbors or go to the bus stops designated in the Public Information Brochure for public transportation. 
      	
      Additional information on the possible length of time that the public might be evacuated was given along with a list of items to take with them, including medical items, identification cards and licenses, clothing and bedding, etc. Instructions for those who should shelter-in-place included closing doors and windows, turning off air intakes (e.g. air conditioners), and preparing for possible evacuation recommendations. 
       The Special News Broadcast prepared to accompany EAS message number two (2), did not contain all of the information necessary to provide the public with instructions on implementing the Protective Action Decisions. Specifically, the message did not include information for pets, schools, and special populations. 
      Evacuees would not know what to do with their pets; to bring them, leave them home, or take them to a Reception Center. Schools may have after school activities taking place and be unaware of what actions they should take during an evacuation. Special Populations would lack instructions and direction on what to do during an evacuation.

    - "Throughout the exercise, several opportunities for improvement in NJ-TF1\xE2\x80\x99s ability to respond to\r\n\
      the incident were identified. The primary areas for improvement, including recommendations,\r\n\
      are as follows:\r\n\
      \xE2\x80\xA2 Base of Operations and initial setup needs to be standardized based on an updated\r\n\
      Mobilization Plan\r\n\
      \xE2\x80\xA2 One 70 person Type I USAR Team (red, white, or blue) as exercise players to be\r\n\
      exercised at any one time.\r\n\
      \xE2\x80\xA2 Exercise injects need to be standardized thru the development, documentation,\r\n\
      review, and implementation\r\n\
      Often when we conduct training, drills, or exercises we are drawn to the identification of the\r\n\
      areas that require improvement. This is, of course, reasonable since exercises are designed to\r\n\
      identify both weaknesses and strengths of an organization. Too often, though, we overlook the\r\n\
      positive aspects of the exercise. NJ-TF1 Annual Exercise 2008 might be viewed through the\r\n\
      negative aspects only, such as the injuries sustained during the exercise, but this would be\r\n\
      shortsighted.\r\n\
      In fact, the exercise was an overall success. And let us not forget that USAR operations routinely\r\n\
      place participants in extremely dangerous environments during training and deployment. Our\r\n\
      training philosophy here at NJ-TF1 is based, in part, on the concept of placing personnel in a\r\n\
      potentially dangerous environment. Our personnel must be able to train in environments that\r\n\
      mimic actual response conditions as closely as possible.\r\n\
      Target capabilities in Command, Search, Rescue, Planning, Logistics, Medical, and WMD\r\n\
      Haz/Mat Components were successfully exhibited during all regular exercise operations.\r\n\
      Significantly, when faced with a \xE2\x80\x9CReal Life\xE2\x80\x9D emergency, members of all components were called\r\n\
      upon to utilize their knowledge, skill, and ability under unforeseen and adverse circumstances. It\r\n\
      is an affirmation of their training and professionalism that the members of NJ-TF1 were\r\n\
      overwhelmingly successful in doing so."

      Staffing - As has been discussed in previous after action reports, the current staffing of the SEOC is not working.  Four SEOC teams exists made up of both OEM and SOS personnel. The problem that occurs during any event is that members assigned to their respective SEOC teams are called to action by their current assignment whether that be OEM Regional duties or SOS deployment activities. Regardless, this creates a major gap in staffing of the SEOC and inevitably leaves the Team leader scrambling to find a replacement.  Additionally, Command occasionally calls for a third person to staff the SEOC in addition to the 2-person Level 3 operational status.  Staffing is already an issue with the current schedule and calling in a third person further exacerbates the problem.

      The need to address the staffing issue is critical and I understand that the Recovery Bureau has submitted a proposal of a workable solution.  Any solution needs to draw upon a group of OEM/SOS personnel that are well-trained in EOC operations and are available to actually work in the EOC and not be deployed to other duties.  Although this proposal may limit the amount of people that are scheduled to work in the SEOC, it will provide a group that is well-versed in the responsibilities of same.

      E-Team - The proper utilization of E-Team by county and municipal OEM personnel is lacking.  The most likely reason for this is that not enough personnel are adequately trained in its use.  An obvious solution to this problem is to have our NJOEM staff conduct E-Team training on site in various counties and municipalities that feel it would be useful.

    - "E-Team - An issue resulted whereby the jurisdiction Sit-Rep for the State was mistakenly deleted when  NJDCA erroneously entered their Sit-Rep under \xE2\x80\x9CState\xE2\x80\x9D instead of under DCA.  When the SEOC Ops Chief realized there were two \xE2\x80\x9CState\xE2\x80\x9D jurisdiction sit-reps he mistakenly hit the delete button on the wrong \xE2\x80\x9CState\xE2\x80\x9D sit rep causing all entries from that time to be lost.  Luckily, all the information was captured by contacting our E-Team support cadre and they were able to provide the lost data.  As a result of this issue, new training procedures or modifications need to take place whereby the Ops Chief is instructed NOT to utilize the delete button. Another solution to this problem would be to remove thedelete feature from the Ops Chief position and just keep it with our E-team experts.      \r\n"

      Ocean County utilizes the telephone as its primary form of communications with the municipalities within the 10-mile Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ).  The following backup communications links are in place between the County and the municipalities 800 MHZ, 500 MHZ, EMRAD, and RACES.
      
      	During the Exercise Long Beach Township and Surf City Borough did not receive a copy of the State of Emergency (SOE) Declaration by the Governor.  This issue was raised with the DCC and the Communications Officer.  The Communications Officer provided documentation the fax was sent to all participating municipalities.  However, no confirmation of receipt was available.

The Communications Officer provided documentation the State of Emergency Declaration was faxed to all participating municipalities.  However, no confirmation of receipt was available. \r\n\

      \tPOSSIBLE CAUSE (what is responsible): The Communications Staff at the Ocean County EOC were unaware of the time delay in sending mass faxes to the municipal EOC\xE2\x80\x99s.  This was compounded by the lack of a procedure to verify receipt of the faxed information.\r\n\

      CONDITION (describe the inadequacy): The second Special News Broadcast (SNB) providing detailed information of the Protective Action Decision was not issued was not faxed until 24 minutes after the airing of the second EAS. 
      
      	POSSIBLE CAUSE (what is responsible): Staff did recognize the urgency of disseminating emergency information to the public.
      
      	REFERENCE (cite the NUREG-0654 Element): F.1.2
      									
      	EFFECT (what resulted, or could have resulted, from the issue): The delay of 24 minutes in the evacuation with the wind at 12 mph placed the public in the plume pathway.

      CONDITION (describe the inadequacy): The second Special News Broadcast (SNB) did not provide instructions for those Emergency Response Planning Areas (ERPAs) recommended to shelter in place.  
      
      	POSSIBLE CAUSE (what is responsible): The preparer of the SNB did not proof read the message prior to release to the public.
      
      	REFERENCE (cite the NUREG-0654 Element): F.1.2
      
      	EFFECT (what resulted, or could have resulted, from the issue): The populations in the ERPAs recommended to shelter in place were not provided physical descriptions of the affected  ERPAs.  This lack of information may have led to residents in those ERPAs continuing outdoor activities.

      IMPROVEMENT PLAN
      
      	Ocean County and the municipalities in the ten-mile Emergency Planning Zone were apprised if the issues from the exercise and suggested corrections.  The County was advised if they intended to use an alternative means of communications compensating measures would be required to ensure all messages were received.  The State suggested if a broadcast fax or email was utilized a roll call acknowledgment by all recipients would verify information was received.

      CONDITION (describe the inadequacy): The first and second Special News Broadcasts (SNB) were faxed only to the Emergency News Center (ENC) and the affected counties (Salem and Cumberland) with the Emergency Alert System radio station omitted at each faxing.  
      
      	POSSIBLE CAUSE (what is responsible): The procedure for the Public Information Officers did not specify the exact recipients for the SNB.  Faxing to the appropriate locations relied upon institutional knowledge.  An inexperienced PIO team participated in this exercise and were unaware of past practices.
      
      	REFERENCE (cite the NUREG-0654 Element): F.1.2
      
      	EFFECT (what resulted, or could have resulted, from the issue): The population in the Emergency Planning Zone never received the specific details supporting the Protective Action Decision.

    - "There are two major types of flooding that occur in New Jersey: riverine flooding and coastal flooding  Riverine flooding is when the rate of rainfall or snowmelt exceeds the rate of infiltration to the ground, the excess water, called runoff, moves across the ground surface toward the lowest section of the watershed. As the surface runoff enters stream channels, stream levels increase. If the rate of runoff is high enough, water in the stream overflows the banks and flooding occurs.  "

    - " Floods can happen almost anywhere in New Jersey, although they do tend to occur in and around areas near existing bodies of water, such as rivers, streams, and the Atlantic Ocean. FEMA Flood Insurance Studies and Flood Insurance Rate Maps, as a rule, identify that the most damaging floods affecting developed areas in New Jersey occur in the northern half of the State.  This is a function of a number of physiographic and physical features of the landscape.  Greater geographic relief of the northern half of the State results in flowing water moving down steeper gradients, naturally or artificially channelized through valleys and gullies.  Development patterns have resulted in denser development in North Jersey, and proximity to New York City boosts property values and thus damage dollar totals.  Extensive development also leaves less natural surface available to absorb rainwater, forcing water directly into streams and rivers, swelling them more than when more natural surface existed.  Since the Delaware, Raritan and Passaic rivers drain more than 90 percent of the northern counties in the State, these rivers and their tributaries are common locations for flooding.   "

    - "Based on history, NFIP records, and analysis engineering data about floodplains (FEMA FIRM, DFIRM and Q3 data, primarily) it is clear that New Jersey is one of the more floodprone States in the nation. The NOAA/NCDC database reports 1169 flood events just since 1996.  The data reporting truncates the list at that year because of its length. The total reported losses related to flooding are $1.82 billion, according to NOAA. Because the definition of flooding is relatively broad, and because flooding can happen virtually anywhere, it is the most prevalent natural hazard almost everywhere in the U.S., including New Jersey. New Jersey has a significant coastline, and many rivers and streams, meaning that floods occur very frequently, although most are relatively minor. "

    - "A storm surge is the rise of water levels during a storm measured by the difference between actual measured water levels and predicted astronomic tide levels. NOAA\xE2\x80\x99s National Climatic Data Center database indicates that since 1996 there have been 1169 floods, of which 141 were categorized as coastal. New Jersey\xE2\x80\x99s has 210-miles of coastline stretching from Raritan Bay in the north, along the Atlantic Coast to Delaware Bay in the south and includes the counties of Atlantic, Cape May, Ocean, and Monmouth.  Though not as costly as other flood events, coastal flooding has caused beach erosion, damage to dunes and shore protection structures as well as tidal flooding impacts. There is an increased risk of flooding when the onset of coastal storms and storm surges occur at high tides.  Slow moving storms can last through many high tides causing a great deal of damage."

    - While the probability of a large tsunami impacting the coast of New Jersey is very small due to the position of New Jersey on the trailing edge of the North Atlantic Plate, the mid-Atlantic region has been subjected to minor tsunami action over the past 250 years and perhaps significant tsunami action over the last geologic period.  Lockridge, et al., (2002) analyzed tsunami and tsunami-like waves that have impacted the east coast of the United States and the National Geophysical Data Center of NOAA compiled a listing of all tsunamis and tsunami-like waves of the eastern United States and Canada. Forty-three potential tsunami events have been identified as possibly impacting the east coast of the United States between 1668 and 1992. Of these events, 15 are categorized as definite or probable tsunamis. Nine of the fifteen events generated either observed or possible impacts along the New Jersey. Three of the events were generated remotely and four were generated locally.

    - Floods are virtually certain to occur somewhere in New Jersey every year, so the Statewide probability is very high. When considering specific sites in the State, however, probability must be estimated using engineering studies or flood insurance statistics. FEMA flood maps and flood insurance studies offer the best available information about where floods are likely to occur, and how often. There is virtually a 100 percent chance of floods occurring somewhere in New Jersey every year. Appendix I of the 2008 plan update includes Q3 and DFIRMs for every County in the State. Flood Insurance Studies can be obtained from the FEMA map service center.

    - The sections immediately below comprise the State loss estimation (risk assessment) for the flood hazard. Although the results of these methodologies provide reasonable loss estimates on a Statewide level, they should be used only as a way to identify areas where relative risk is higher, with the purpose of further assessment as the State or local jurisdictions develop and prioritize potential mitigation efforts.  Because flooding is clearly the most significant natural hazard risk in New Jersey and there is a large amount of data available about flood losses, the present hazard identification section includes a more detailed calculation of future losses (risk) than is afforded the other hazards. The following subsections estimate future losses based on several related methodologies. Note that Appendix G of this plan (Severe Repetitive Loss Mitigation Strategy) includes more detailed flood loss estimations for Repetitive Loss and Severe Repetitive Loss properties in New Jersey, based on the most current NFIP data available.

    - An accurate way to estimate future flood losses is to utilize historical data as the basis for calculating future losses. In the case of New Jersey, there is an extensive history of flood claims, which indicates more than 82,000 claims since the inception of the NFIP in the late 1970s. The State has one of the highest number of claims of any in the country, and is also among the highest in repetitive flood claims (as defined by FEMA/NFIP, see related discussion elsewhere in this section). Although this is clearly not a positive statistic for the State, it does mean that there is a rich data set on which to base estimations of additional losses. The most reliable methodology for doing so is to annualize the losses, then calculate future losses using a present value coefficient that expresses combinations of time horizons and discount rate. This is a standard statistical methodology, and is used by FEMA in its various benefit-cost analysis software programs. The Office of Management and Budget requires most federal agencies to use a 7% discount rate in assessing benefits of their activities and programs, and that is used in the present calculation. The results of the calculations are displayed in Table 4.4.1.6-1 and a map of New Jersey broken into counties for clarification can be found in Figure 4.5-1-4.

    - "This risk loss estimation methodology uses historical repetitive flood loss insurance claims data as the basis for estimating future losses. The methodology is based on annualizing losses by dividing the total losses by the number of years since the inception of the NFIP, then projecting future losses using a standard present value coefficient (which integrates the required 7% discount rate with planning horizons of 50 and 100 years, respectively). This type of analysis is reasonably accurate on a large scale such as a State, but County-level data should be reviewed carefully prior to use in local or regional planning exercises.  Note that the columns entitled \xE2\x80\x9C50-year risk\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9C100-year risk\xE2\x80\x9D are projections of annual losses for whole Counties. The columns at the far right of the table show projected future losses (risk) on a per-policy basis. The secondary (shaded) rows for each County show the same data for only those policies that have made four or more claims against the NFIP. The data can be used by the State and regions to identify patterns indicating  where the most significant claims history has been. Note to local and regional planning entities: this data can be obtained in a spreadsheet form, and extends to the level of individual claims.  "

    - "\tFlood Loss Estimation Method 3 - Estimated Annual Damages for 1% (100-year) Probability Floods  This flood risk assessment methodology is completed by using the HAZUS estimates of total exposure for all land use categories, combined with the results of the GIS-based analysis of DFIRM and Q3 data. The latter were used to estimate the percentage of land area in A zones (assumed to be 100-year floodplain) for each County in the State. The fourth column (A Zone Exposure) shows the total value of assets in each County that is potentially exposed to a one percent annual chance of flooding. This methodology is constrained by the uncertainty of the value of assets that are actually in the 100-year floodplain, but offers a perspective on the potential annual damages in each County, and Statewide. Potential damages are directly correlated to the value of assets in the Counties, but the coefficient floodplain percentage also has a significant effect on the outcome. "

    - "Because of its northern location on the Atlantic coastline, direct hits by storms of hurricane strength have a relatively low probability of impacting New Jersey, compared to the Southern coastal and Gulf States. It is possible for the entire State to be impacted by hurricanes, although wind and surge effects tend to be concentrated in coastal areas, as well as specific riverine regions that may experience storm surge backwater effects.  The cooler waters off the coast of New Jersey can serve to diminish the energy of storms that have traveled up the eastern seaboard in the Gulf Stream current.  However, historical data shows that a number of hurricanes/tropical storms have impacted New Jersey, often as the remnants of a large storm hitting the Gulf or Atlantic coast hundreds of miles south of New Jersey, but maintaining sufficient wind and precipitation to cause substantial damage to the State.

    - "\xEF\x83\x98\tFlooding.   Flooding causes severe damage in New Jersey during hurricanes.  Flooding and flash floods brought by the torrential rains of a hurricane are dangerous killers.  Rain delivered by tropical storm can amount to almost nothing to as much as 15 inches in two to three days. Hurricane Diane (1955) caused little damage as it moved into the continent, but long after its winds subsided, it brought floods to Pennsylvania, New York and New England that killed 200 persons and cost an estimated 700 million dollars in damage.  In 1972, Agnes fused with another storm system, flooding stream, and river basins in the Northeast with more than a foot of rain in less than 12 hours, killing 117 people and causing almost three billion dollars of damage."

    - "\xEF\x83\x98\tStorm Surge.  It is estimated that 90 percent of deaths and most property damage near the coast during hurricanes are caused by storm surge.  Storm surge occurs when coastal waters are pushed toward shore and held above mean sea level.  Depending on storm size, characteristics and distance from the shoreline, the storm can raise the sea level of along 50 or more miles of coastline by 20 or more feet.  The higher sea level, along with the wind-enhanced hammering of waves, act as a giant bulldozer sweeping everything in its path.  In fact, during at least two hurricanes this century, New Jersey\xE2\x80\x99s barrier islands Island Beach and Long Beach Island experienced a complete over wash as a result of the storm surge, with waves completely washing over the islands taking with them homes and other infrastructure. The damage does not end with destruction from wave action effects.  Still-water damage from inundated structures and facilities is exacerbated by the harmful effects of saltwater.  Structures, once salted, will remain more susceptible to moisture, leading to mildewing and corrosion of the structure and all contents that came in contact with the saltwater. "

Minor damage begins at approximately 50 MPH and includes broken branches.  Moderate damage, such as broken window and loosed shingles begins around 80 MPH, and major structural damage and destruction begins at 100 MPH.  For some structures, wind force alone is sufficient to cause total destruction.  Mobile homes with their lack of foundation, light weight, and minimal anchoring make them particularly vulnerable to hurricane winds.  Some hurricanes spawn tornadoes that contribute to the damage delivered by hurricanes.  Tornadoes are discussed in the thunderstorms & tornadoes section of this report. Winds to the right of the storm track typically cause more damage because wind speed is added to track speed. New Jersey, typically to the left of the storm track, tends to suffer less damage than Long Island."

    - "Because they are relatively infrequent in the Northeastern U.S., it is impossible to assign accurate probabilities to hurricanes and tropical storms in the region, except on a very long-term basis. As noted, such storms that do impact the region are often remnants of hurricanes rather than named events, so their effects often appear as floods or (to a lesser extent) as windstorms, rather than hurricanes or tropical storms. Because the reporting period is relatively long, it is reasonable to assume that the probabilities of these events will remain about the same in the future, with the region experiencing the effects of a hurricane every 15 or 20 years, and tropical storms perhaps every five years.

    - "A nor'easter is a macro-scale storm whose winds come from the northeast, especially in the coastal areas of the Northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada. More specifically, it describes a low pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the coast and whose leading winds in the left forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast. The precipitation pattern is similar to other extra-tropical storms. They also can cause coastal flooding, coastal erosion and gale force winds. As with hurricanes, coastal areas of the State tend to be affected most by Nor\xE2\x80\x99easters because of their proximity to the ocean, but all parts of New Jersey have some exposure to the hazard, and past effects have been widespread.  Nor'easters are usually formed by an area of vorticity associated with an upper level disturbance or from a kink in a frontal surface that causes a surface low pressure area to develop. Such storms often move slowly in their latter, frequently intense, mature stage. Until the nor'easter passes, thick dark clouds often block out the sun. During a single storm, the precipitation can range from a torrential downpour to a fine mist. Low temperatures and wind gusts of up to 90 miles per hour are also associated with nor'easters. Figure 4.4-3-1 below describes the different intensities of Nor\xE2\x80\x99easter storms."

    - "The Atlantic coast, from northern Georgia northward up the coast, can suffer high winds, pounding surf and extremely heavy rains during these storms. Nor'easters cause a significant amount of severe beach erosion in these areas, as well as flooding in low-lying areas. Beach residents in these areas may actually fear the repeated depredations of nor'easters over those of hurricanes, because they happen more frequently, and cause substantial damage to beach-front property and their dunes. The northeastern United States, from New Jersey to the New England coast, Quebec and Atlantic Canada see nor'easters each year, most often in the winter and early spring, but also sometimes during the autumn. These storms can leave inches of rain or several feet of snow on the region, and sometimes last for several days. "

Although this storm did not produce record surge levels, it inflicted substantially greater overall damages and loss of life than any other storm. This was primarily due to the prolonged duration of the storm that caused damaging over wash and flooding through five successive high tides. Increased development along the coast since the 1944 hurricane also accounted for increased damages. This storm was also responsible for the loss of 22 lives, completely destroyed 1,853 homes and caused major damage to approximately 2,000 additional homes. The total damage caused by this storm to public and private property was about $85 million (1962 dollars)."

    - "Nature of the Winter Storm Hazard Heavy snowfall and extreme cold can immobilize an entire region. Even areas that normally experience mild winters can be hit with a major snowstorm or extreme cold. Winter storms can result in flooding, storm surge, closed highways, blocked roads, downed power lines and hypothermia.  The following descriptions provide the commonly used definitions of winter storms: \xEF\x83\x98\tWinter storm. A storm with significant snowfall, ice, and/or freezing rain; the quantity of precipitation varies by elevation.  o\tNon-mountainous areas - heavy snowfall is 4 inches or more in a 12-hour period, or 6 or more inches in a 24-hour period o\tMountainous areas - 12 inches or more in a 12-hour period or 18 inches or more in a 24-hour period \xEF\x83\x98\tBlizzard. A storm with considerable falling and/or blowing snow combined with sustained winds or frequent gusts of 35 mph or greater that frequently reduces visibility to less than one-quarter mile. These storms derive their energy from the clash of two air masses of substantially different temperatures and moisture levels. An air mass is a large region above the Earth, usually about 1,000-5,000 km in diameter, with a fairly uniform temperature and moisture level. In North America, winter storms usually form when an air mass of cold, dry, Canadian air moves south and interacts with a warm, moist air mass moving north from the Gulf of Mexico. The point where these two air masses meet is called a front. If cold air advances and pushes away the warm air, it forms a cold front. When warm air advances, it rides up over the denser, cold air mass to form a warm front. If neither air mass advances, it forms a stationary front. "

    - "Winter storms affect the entire State of New Jersey about equally, and are responsible for many deaths each year.  Of reported deaths, more than 33 percent were attributed to automobile and other accidents; about 30 percent to overexertion, exhaustion, and consequent heart attack; about 13 percent to exposure and freezing; and the rest to combustion heater fires, carbon monoxide poisoning in stalled cars, falls on slippery walks, electrocution from downed wires, and building collapse.  Communications systems and medical care delivery can be disrupted during winter hazard conditions, exacerbating hazards already part of the winter experience.  Some of these deaths may be eliminated through the application of better forecasting and mitigation measures.  Older people are particularly sensitive to overexposure because of their economic and physical condition.  Often senior citizens do not feel they have the income to heat their homes properly and they leave their homes far less heated than they should.  In addition, senior citizen\xE2\x80\x99s changing sensitivities to heat and cold often result in their not realizing the temperatures they are experiencing are dangerously low.  This leads to increased stresses on the body, especially when exerting themselves outside. "

    - Snow Heavy snow accumulations can immobilize a region and paralyze a city, stranding commuters, stopping the flow of supplies, and disrupting emergency and medical services. Ice storms can be accompanied by high winds, and they have similar impacts, especially to trees, power lines, and residential utility services. New Jersey, because of its unique location at a climactic crossroads and distinctive geography, experiences the full effect of all four seasons, and winter is no exception.  Snowstorms are the most obvious manifestation of intense winter weather.   The most common conditions for snowstorm formation begin with the formation of a storm-system somewhere in a crescent-shaped zone running from Texas through the northern Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean waters off Georgia and the Carolinas.  Storm centers moving northeast pass near Cape Hatteras and continue over the Ocean toward Cape Cod and Nantucket.  If this mass of air meets a northeast already cooled by cold arctic air, a snowstorm can form.  Snow begins in cooling clouds as water droplets freezing around an ice-covered particle of matter.  Once the ice crystal grows large enough to leave the cloud, it falls as a snowflake.  If the air into which the snow is falling through has not cooled sufficiently, the snow will ultimately fall as rain. The trajectory of the storm center, whether it passes close to the New Jersey coast or at a distance, largely determines both the intensity and the duration of the snowfall over the State. The zone of heaviest snowfall across New Jersey usually occurs in the southwest-to-northeast strip about 150 miles wide, approximately parallel to the path of the storm center, and about 125 and 175 miles northwest of it. (Figure 4.4-4-1 Average Yearly Snowfall)  If the center passes well offshore, only South Jersey receives substantial snowfall.  When the track passes close to shore, warm air from the Ocean is drawn into the surface circulation, resulting in rain falling over South Jersey and snow over the rest of the State.  Often, a passing storm center brings rain to the South, mixed precipitation to central sections and snow to the north.

    - Seasonal snowfall in New Jersey varies from an average of about 15 inches at Atlantic City to about 50 inches in Sussex County.  There is, however, great variability from year to year.  In addition, February is the month when maximum accumulations on the ground are usually reached.  After three major snows in February 1961, total accumulations reached 30 to 50 inches from Trenton to the Highlands

    - "Most extreme snowfall events occur as the result of strong low pressure systems moving to the north, northeast off of the coast of New Jersey from early winter through mid-spring. If the conditions are right, these coastal lows transport Atlantic moisture over a cold layer of air over New Jersey resulting in extremely high snowfall rates and occasionally blizzard conditions.  Between 1926 \xE2\x80\x932010 significant snowfalls have occurred in 1933, 1947, 1958, 1961, 1978, 1996, 2001, 2003, and 2010, with the greatest single day snowfall of 28.4 inches occurring along the coast in Long Branch, NJ on December 26, 1947  "

    - Beyond disruption to transportation, the main hazard associated with snow is the weight of the frozen liquid on buildings and utilities. The ground snow load in pounds per square foot varies with the amount of water content in the ice crystals that make up the snow. Large snowfalls with low water content can generate the same snow load as a light snowfall with high water content. Ground snow loads in pounds per square foot with a 2% probability of being exceeded have been tabulated by the American Society of Engineers Standard ASCE 7-98, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures. Snow loads with a 1 in 50 chance of occurring over 100 years range from 20 lb/sq. ft. south of the Atlantic City Expressway and along the Atlantic Ocean coast to over 35 lb/sq.ft. in Northwester New Jersey. Extreme variations in snow loads within the Highlands section of New Jersey require the use of specific engineering case studies to determine appropriate ground snow loads.

    - Ice Storms Although snow is the weather phenomenon most commonly associated with winter, ice storms are a much greater winter menace.  The freezing rain that coats all objects in a sheath of ice can cause power outages, structural damage, and damaging tree falls. Ice storms occur when rain droplets fall through freezing air and but do not freeze until they touch objects such as trees, roads, or structures.  A clear icy sheath, known as a glaze, forms around branches, structures and wires and has been known to bring down high-tension utility, radio, and television transmission towers.

    - "All regions of New Jersey have been and continue to be subject to ice storms.  Besides temperature, their occurrence depends on the regional distribution of the pressure systems, as well as local weather conditions.  The distribution of ice storms often coincides with general distribution of snow within several zones in the State.  A cold rain may be falling over the southern portion of the State, freezing rain over the central region, and snow over the northern counties as a coastal storm moves northeastward offshore.  A locality\xE2\x80\x99s distance to the passing storm center is often the crucial factor in determining the temperature and type of precipitation during a winter storm."

    - "Normally experiencing lower temperatures on most winter days, the north has a greater chance of all types of winter storms occurring.  Elevation can play a role in lowering the temperature to cause ice and snow to form on hilltops while valley locations remain above freezing, receiving only rain or freezing rain.  Often a difference of only one or two hundred feet can make a difference between liquid rain, adhering ice, and snow.  Essex County\xE2\x80\x99s Orange Mountains, with an elevation of only two hundred feet above the valley, have on occasion been locked in an icy sheath while valley residents have experienced only rain.  Conversely, ice storms may occur in valleys and not on hilltops if cold air gets trapped in the valleys of regions with greater relief."

    - "Cold Waves and Wind Chill  Two dangers of winter do not even involve precipitation.  A cold wave, as used in the U.S. National Weather Service, a rapid fall in temperature within 24 hours to temperatures requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities and involves both the rate of temperature fall and the minimum to which it falls. A cold wave is classified as a rapid drop of 20 degrees, to below between 28 and 10 degrees, depending on the time of year and whether the drop occurs in the southern or northern half of the State.    The extreme northwest corner of New Jersey can expect temperatures as low as zero degrees almost every year, and the State\xE2\x80\x99s entire northwest quarter about once every two years.  In this section of New Jersey, the combined effects of latitude, topography, and elevation create favorable radiational cooling conditions at night, with low temperatures resulting.  A second area of lower temperatures is found in the Pine Barrens, where the flat terrain and strong radiational quality of the sandy soil produce low temperatures.  The central part of Burlington County, the center of the Pine Barrens, can expect a zero reading once every two years.    The central and south coasts are the least susceptible to zero temperatures, with a zero reading occurring less than once every ten years.  Urban complexes, such as Newark and Trenton, can expect a zero reading only once or twice in ten years, because of the heat-island effect resulting from the retention of heat by buildings and pavements, the reduction of nocturnal radiation by pollution-laden atmosphere, input of heat into the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion, and emanation of waste heat from heated and cooled buildings.  Wind chills can make winter a more dangerous.  Very strong winds combined with temperatures slightly below freezing can have the same chilling effect as a temperature nearly 50 degrees F lower in a calm atmosphere.  Arctic explorers and military experts have developed what is called the \"wind-chill factor\", which calculates an equivalent calm-air temperature for the combined effects of wind and temperature.  In effect, the index describes the cooling power of air on exposed flesh and to a lesser extent a clothed person.  Wind-chill temperatures throughout New Jersey annually fall below zero a number of times each winter, with wind chills in Northwestern New Jersey occasionally reaching 30 degrees F below zero."

    - "Winter Storm Occurrences  New Jersey's middle latitude location results in snow falling in all portions of the state each winter. There have been several unusual winters in the past century when measurable snow (greater than or equal to 0.1\") has failed to fall or been almost absent over southern portions of the state, but these are rare exceptions. On average, seasonal snowfall totals 10\"-20\" in the southern third of the state, 20\"-30\" in the central third and 30\"-40\" in the lower elevations of the northern third. The higher northern locations receive 40\"-60\". These averages are not particularly meaningful, as inter-annual variations may be on the order of feet. Two winters within the past decade exemplify the variability. Statewide, the winter of 1997/98 was one of the least snowy on record (1972-73 had the least snow). Less than 5\" fell in most of southern and central NJ, with only the northwest corner of the state having close to half of their annual average. Conversely, the winter of 1995/96 was the snowiest on record in NJ. As much as 110\" fell at High Point, with record breaking amounts, as much as 20\" over former records, in northeast and central NJ. Less snow fell to the south, however totals still were commonly twice or more the annual average.

January 7, 1996\tBlizzard\tA State of Emergency was declared for the blizzard that hit the State. Snowfall amounts ranged from 30 inches in southern interior sections to 14 inches in coastal areas. Road conditions were dangerous due to the high winds and drifts. Because of these road conditions, a non-essential travel ban was issued and mass transit operations were suspended. Both government and contract snow plowing operations were running at a maximum. Local roads were impassable. This blizzard also brought on coastal flooding with the high tides of Sunday evening and Monday morning, and there were reports of damage to dunes and beaches from the heavy wave activity. Evacuations were instituted in Cape May, Ocean and Monmouth counties. A total of nine Red Cross Shelters were opened, and provided equipment for two community shelters. More than 400 National Guard personnel were activated for transport assistance, primarily for medic missions.  February 16, 2003\tSnow Storm\tThe combination of the very cold temperatures and the approach of a strong storm system caused widespread snow to break out, starting before sunrise on Sunday, February 16th. Snow continued during the day Sunday, heavy at times, and continued into Sunday night before mixing with and changing to sleet and rain in the southeastern part of the state later Sunday night. Precipitation continued on Monday, before finally coming to an end on Tuesday. When all was said and done, a significant snowfall occurred across the entire state of New Jersey. Total snowfall across New Jersey ranged from 12 to 24 inches.   The President's Day snowstorm tied or set records in all 21 New Jersey counties, and all municipalities were involved in states of emergency. New Jersey requested and was granted a Snow Emergency Declaration. February 5-6 and 9-10, 2010\tSnow Storm\tA strong Nor'easter impacted the state from Friday evening February 5th through Saturday the 6th. The highest accumulations occurred in the southern half of the state, with snow totals of 20-30 inches common from Camden and Atlantic counties southward. Winds up to 50 mph produced blizzard conditions in the southeastern part of the state during the morning of the 6th. Cape May County was particularly hard hit, with 70,000 homes and business losing power.   A second storm occurred within the same week on the 9th and 10th. However, storm totals were not as much as the 5th-6th event, snowfall was still significant and averaged 7 to 15 inches across northwest New Jersey, 12 to 20 inches across central New Jersey and 6 to 12 inches across the southern third of New Jersey. Though snowfall totals were lighter in southern NJ, the weight of additional rain and snow on top of the previous storm's heavy snowpack led to several roof collapses, tree damage, and about 100,000 new power outages.

High straight-line winds related to thunderstorms affect nearly all areas of the State equally, although tornadoes are relatively uncommon in the northeast part of the U.S. compared to the central and south-central States. The potential for a tornado strike is about equal across New Jersey, except in the northern parts of the State, which generally have steeper terrain, are less likely to experience tornadoes. "

    - "Tornadoes  These are nature\xE2\x80\x99s most violent storms and can cause fatalities and devastate a neighborhood in seconds. A tornado appears as a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach 250 miles per hour.  Damage paths can be in excess of one mile wide and 50 miles long. Before a tornado hits, the wind may die down and the air may become very still. A cloud of debris can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel is not visible.  Tornadoes generally occur near the trailing edge of a thunderstorm. It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado. Tornadoes are typically developed from either a severe thunderstorm or hurricane as cool air rapidly over-rides a layer of warm air. This causes the warm air to rise rapidly as a funnel shaped cloud.  The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of 250 mph or more. The severity of tornadoes is measured by the Fujita Scale and illustrated in Table 4.4-5.2-1 below. This table provides the level of destruction which may occur with each level of intensity."

The tornado remained on the ground for 6.6 miles before it crossed the border into New York State. Its maximum width was about 100 yards and its highest estimated wind speed was 120 mph.

    - "Probability of Future Occurrences Tornado distribution throughout the State is uncertain and does not exhibit readily identifiable patterns. Therefore, the areas selected for the vulnerability analysis at highest risk are those of highest urbanization. Recent advances in technology and prediction methodologies have enabled the Storm Prediction Center of the National Weather Service to provide the public with up to a 15-minute warning of an approaching tornado compared to only three minutes in 1978. This advance warning will definitely reduce deaths and injuries associated with tornadoes, and may also reduce property damage, at least at the fringes of the path, by allowing loose objects to be better sheltered or secured.  A recent study from NOAA\xE2\x80\x99s National Severe Storms Laboratory provided highly accurate and accessible estimates of the long-term threat from tornadoes.  Using historical data, the NSSL estimated the daily probability of a tornado occurring near any location in the U.S for any tornado no matter how strong or weak (i.e., no matter what its magnitude). The NSSL map below (Figure 4.4.5.5-1) can be used to obtain these estimates. For example, the NSSL estimates a probability for any tornado of about 1.3 days per year in south-central Oklahoma, and 0.4 to 0.6 days per year in southern New York."

    - "Thunderstorms   Along with high winds, thunderstorms can bring other hazards including lightning and flash flooding. In the United States, an average of 300 people is injured and 80 people are killed each year by lightning. Dry thunderstorms that do not produce rain that reaches the ground are most prevalent in the western United States. Falling raindrops evaporate, but lightning can still reach the ground and can start wildfires. Thunderstorms affect relatively small areas when compared with hurricanes and winter storms. The typical thunderstorm is 15 miles in diameter and lasts an average of 30 minutes. Despite their small size, thunderstorms are dangerous. Of the estimated 100,000 thunderstorms that occur each year in the United States, about 10 percent are classified as severe. (FEMA.gov)  During the warm season, thunderstorms are responsible for most of the rainfall. Cyclones and frontal passages are less frequent during this time. Thunderstorms spawned in Pennsylvania and New York State often moves into Northern New Jersey, where they often reach maximum development in the evening. This region has about twice as many thunderstorms as the coastal zone, where the nearby ocean helps stabilize the atmosphere. (http://climate.rutgers.edu/stateclim_v1/njclimoverview.html). The conditions most favorable to thunderstorm development occur between June and August, with July being the peak month for all weather stations in New Jersey.  "

Quite often, straight-line winds are associated with thunderstorms and their intense downbursts; however, any frontal passage, storm, or significant gradient between high and low pressure zones in the region can be result in damaging winds.  These winds have been known to cause tornado like damage and even be mistaken for tornadoes to the untrained observer.  Straight-line winds occur more often in areas with large expanses unbroken by buildings or geographic relief and as with tornadoes are associated with thunderstorms.  They often cause extensive crop damage "

    - For the State, an average of thirty thunderstorms a year occurs for each locality, with more storms occurring in the northwestern portion of the state than the eastern portion (Figure 4.4.5.4-2 Distribution of Thunderstorm Days). This is because the passage of air masses most commonly associated with storms and other weather phenomenon, known as frontal passages, is in a generally west to east direction.  Thus, thunderstorms created in New York State and Pennsylvania are carried into New Jersey.  Geologic relief in Pennsylvania, New York and northern New Jersey enhance the intensity and frequency of thunderstorm development, which is why there are more thunderstorms in the northern portion of the State.  As a result, Sussex County experiences twice as many thunderstorms as Cape May County.

It is not possible to predict exactly when and where future earthquakes will occur.  Thus, seismic hazard is expressed in probabilistic terms.

These maps are national consensus, United States Geological Survey estimates, which are used in building codes (along with other maps showing spectral acceleration values) and for seismic risk assessments.    Figure 4.4-6-2 shows the 10% in 50-year earthquake ground motion contours for the central and eastern United States.

    - The 10% in 50-year and 2% in 50-year contour maps shown below represent probabilistic ground motions that are expected to occur, on average, about once every 500 years and about once every 2500 years, respectively.  However, earthquakes with these levels of ground motions could occur anytime time.  For example, over the next 10 years, there is about a 2% chance of experiencing the 10% in 50-year ground motions and about a 0.4% chance of experiencing the 2% in 50-year ground motions at any location in New Jersey.   As shown by the seismic hazard maps below, the level of seismic hazard is highest in northern New Jersey, especially in the northeast corner of the State.  Within this area, the level of seismic hazard is especially high in locations underlain by soft soils because soft soil sites amplify earthquake ground motions resulting in much higher levels of shaking (and damage) than on nearby firm soil or rock sites.  The following geologic map for the seven counties in northeastern New Jersey with the highest level of seismic hazard shows areas of soft soils where the level of seismic hazard and risk is especially high.

    - "Probability of Earthquakes  In any given year, the probability of damaging earthquakes affecting New Jersey is low.  Nevertheless, current understanding of the seismicity in the northeastern United States, as reflected in the USGS seismic hazard maps shown above is conclusive:  there is a definite threat of major earthquakes which could cause widespread damages and casualties in New Jersey.  Major damaging earthquakes are infrequent in New Jersey and may occur only once every few hundred years or longer, but the consequences of major earthquakes would be very high.  As shown in the figures above, the 10% in 50-year ground motions are about 6% g shaking in northeastern New Jersey, 4% to 6% in much of northern New Jersey and below 4% in southern New Jersey.  At these levels of shaking, the potential for damage to buildings or infrastructure is very low, with only very minimal damage expected, even for rather vulnerable facilities.  As shown in Figure 4.4.6.2-4, the 2% in 50-year ground motions are much higher than the 10% in 50-year ground motions.  The ground motions are above 20% G in northeastern New Jersey, above 16% G for all of northern New Jersey, and 8% to 16% G for southern New Jersey.  At these levels of shaking, there would be substantial damages to vulnerable buildings and infrastructure, especially in northern New Jersey.  However, a very important aspect of seismic hazards in New Jersey is that the expected levels of ground shaking from future earthquakes depends only on location within the State, but also on soil conditions at specific locations.  The levels of ground shaking shown on the figures above are for rock sites.  Locations underlain by firm soils, and especially locations underlain by soft soils, will experience significantly higher levels of ground shaking than nearby locations on rock sites.  For firm soil sites, ground motions are likely to be as much as 40% to 60% higher than shown above.  For very soft soil locations, ground motions are likely to be from 70% to as much as 250% higher than shown above."

    - "For the 10% in 50- ground motions, the levels of shaking, for firm soil sites are expected to be below 10% G.  At such levels of shaking, the potential for damage to buildings and infrastructure is generally low, with low levels of damage for most structures, even vulnerable structures, with only extremely vulnerable structures perhaps experiencing major damage. However, for the 10% in 50-year ground motions, the levels of shaking for soft soil sites in northern New Jersey would be in the 10% to 15% G range.  At this level of shaking, many vulnerable structures may have low to moderate levels of damage, with highly vulnerable structures experiencing major damage.  For the 2% in 50-year ground motions, levels of shaking on firm soil sites would be in the 15% to 25% G range for much of the State.  At such levels of shaking, widespread damage to vulnerable structures is expected.  For soft soil sites, levels of shaking would be above 20% G for much of the State and above 30% G in northeastern New Jersey.  At such levels of shaking very widespread damage is expected, with heavy damage to many vulnerable structures, and possible collapse of some highly vulnerable structures.  A very important characteristic of earthquake risk is that it is not uniform.  Rather, earthquake damage is always concentrated in the most vulnerable buildings and infrastructure.  The building types most vulnerable to earthquake damage include:  un-reinforced masonry, pre-cast concrete buildings, tilt-up buildings, and some concrete frame buildings.  Buildings of the above structural systems may be especially vulnerable if they have soft first stories and very irregular configurations.  Most wood frame buildings perform relatively well in earthquakes, with two exceptions.  Buildings with cripple wall foundations and buildings with sill plates not bolted to the foundation are very vulnerable to earthquake damage.  Cripple wall foundations are short stud walls which raise the first floor two or three feet above grade; these walls are subject to collapse in earthquakes if not adequately braced.  Infrastructure that may be especially vulnerable includes some types of older bridges, especially multispan bridges, and high voltage (220 kV or higher) electric substations with unanchored transformers and non-seismically rated equipment.  The level of risk \xE2\x80\x93 the threat to buildings, infrastructure and people \xE2\x80\x93 from earthquakes in New Jersey is addressed in the following section, which includes quantitative earthquake loss estimates."

    - "HAZUS Earthquake Loss Estimates for Seven Northeastern New Jersey Counties  The New Jersey Geological Survey used FEMA\xE2\x80\x99s HAZUS Loss Estimation software to make quantitative loss estimates for several scenario earthquakes.  The scenario was run in seven counties in northeastern New Jersey:  Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, and Union.  Summary results are given in Table 4.4.6.4-1 below.   For each County, five scenario earthquakes were considered:  M5.0, M5.5, M6.0, M6.5, and M7.0 with an epicenter at the centroid of the County and a depth of 10 kilometers.  Two sets of geologic rock/soil data were evaluated:  a) the default rock-soil data in HAZUS and b) updated New Jersey-specific rock/soil data compiled by the New Jersey Geological Survey.  The New Jersey-specific data are more accurate.  Thus, the results summarized below all reflect the HAZUS runs using the New Jersey-specific rock/soil data.  The New Jersey-specific rock/soil resulted in somewhat lower damage estimates than the default HAZUS results in areas of rock or very firm dense soils and higher damage estimates in areas of soft, liquefiab"

    - "Limitations of the HAZUS Results  The results displayed in the table above should be interpreted cautiously because they are more like worst-case scenarios than typical earthquakes for New Jersey. First, each scenario earthquake is assumed to be located at the centroid of a County.  The historic record shows a clustering of earthquakes in northeastern New Jersey and adjacent New York.  This observation is the reason why the contours of ground motion in New Jersey are highest at the extreme northeast corner of the state and systematically decrease to the west and south.  Second, for earthquakes within New Jersey or nearby, the most likely significant earthquakes are in the M5 to M5.5 magnitude range, with earthquakes of larger magnitude being possible but very unlikely.  An M7.0 earthquake is probably the largest magnitude earthquake possible anywhere in the northeastern United States and adjacent parts of Canada.  While such an earthquake is possible, it very unlikely to occur in or very near New Jersey.  In combination, the above two factors mean that the return periods for the scenario earthquakes modeled in the HAZUS runs are very long \xE2\x80\x93 somewhat above 2,500 years for the smaller M5.0 or M5.5 scenarios and well above 2,500 years for the M6.0 or larger scenarios.  Thus, the levels of ground shaking and the corresponding levels of damage expected for more likely earthquakes affecting New Jersey will be substantially lower than any of the scenarios summarized and drastically lower than the M7.0 scenario results.  A further caveat on the scenario results presented below is that each earthquake scenario was evaluated only for damages within a single County.  More realistically, these scenarios would also result in significant damages and casualties in adjacent and nearby counties.  Thus, for example, building damages for the M7.0 scenario in Bergen County are shown as about $15 billion.  For New Jersey overall, building damages could be several times the Bergen County estimate, with most of the damage in adjacent counties.  In interpreting the loss estimates above, it is important to remember that all of these results are much more like worst case scenarios and not representative of the major damaging earthquakes most likely to affect New Jersey.  The most likely damaging earthquakes for New Jersey would be moderate size earthquakes, roughly M5.0 to M5.5.  Earthquakes on these faults would affect the counties nearest the epicenter most strongly, but would have effects in all of the northern New Jersey counties, with minor effects perhaps extending to mid- or southern New Jersey as well.  The above caveats notwithstanding, the scenario results for M5.0 and M5.5 earthquakes are reasonably representative of the damage expected from New Jersey earthquakes with these magnitudes, although the damages will not be limited to a single County.  For earthquakes of similar magnitudes in New York, damage levels in New Jersey will be less, depending on the distance to the epicenter."

    - Statewide Earthquake Loss Estimates for New Jersey  As discussed above the most likely earthquakes affecting New Jersey are M5.0 or M5.5 earthquakes in northeastern New Jersey or adjacent New York.   Loss estimates for individual counties for earthquakes representative of such earthquakes were shown above for the seven northeastern counties.  Each of these scenario earthquakes was postulated to be at the centroid of a given County.   For such earthquakes, the Statewide impacts can be estimated approximately.  For such small to moderate earthquakes most of the damage will be near the epicenter, within the County in which the earthquake occurs.  For a M5.0 earthquake in any of these seven counties, the Statewide loss estimates are likely to be approximately 50% to 100% more than the single County estimate, with total property damage in the $2 billion range, with perhaps several hundred injuries and possibly a few deaths.   Such an event would be roughly a once in 150-year event.    It is important to note that Statewide estimates or seven-County estimates cannot be made simply by summing the results because each County loss estimate represents a different earthquake (at the centroid of each County).  Thus, for example, the seven M5.0 loss estimates represent seven different earthquakes.  For larger earthquakes, such as M6.0 or M7.0, the most likely epicenters would also be in these seven northeastern Counties.  For such larger earthquakes, damaging effects occur over wider geographic areas and thus the ratio of Statewide losses to the losses in the County where the earthquake occurred would be higher than for the M5.0 scenarios discussed above.  For an M6.0 earthquake, statewide losses would likely be 2 or 3 times the single County losses.  Total property damage might be in the $10 billion to $15 billion range, with perhaps 5,000 or 10,000 injuries and a few dozen to possibly a few hundred deaths.  Such damage would be highly concentrated in the nearest County to the epicenter and in adjacent counties, with very limited damage in more distant counties.    For an M7.0 earthquake, which would represent the worst case scenario for New Jersey, with return periods in the many thousands of years, the Statewide losses would likely be 5 to 10 times higher than the single County estimates, with total property damages roughly in the $50 billion to $100 billion range, with tens of thousands of injuries and perhaps over 1,000 deaths.  These damages would be concentrated in the nearest County to the epicenter and in adjacent counties, with some damage in further away counties.  However, even a very large M7.0 earthquake in northeastern New Jersey would have only minor effects in central New Jersey and nearly negligible effects in southern New Jersey.

    - "\tExtrapolation of HAZUS Loss Estimates to All Counties in New Jersey  As an alternative to the general estimates described in the paragraphs above, the HAZUS Total Economic Loss (TEL) figures for an M5.5 earthquake (for the seven Counties for which such estimates have been calculated) are used to extrapolate potential loss figures for the other Counties in the State. As estimated by HAZUS, TEL values for the seven studied Counties average 2.9% of the total exposure (i.e. total value of assets). For this table, a simple extrapolation as 2.9% of total exposure was used for all Counties in the State. This data should be regarded as useful for planning purposes only, as it does not account for variations in the numerous factors that influence earthquake losses.

    - "Nature of the Drought Hazard in New Jersey Drought is a period of drier-than-normal conditions that results in community water issues.  Low precipitation may also dry out soils and threaten agriculture. When precipitation is less than normal for long enough, stream flows decrease, water levels in lakes and reservoirs fall and the depth to reach well water increases. Although below-normal rainfall does not automatically result in drought conditions, persistent dry weather and water-supply issues may evolve into a drought emergency. Because droughts are generally the results of meteorological patterns, the entire State of New Jersey is about equally subject to their effects.  As shown in Table 4.4-7-1, nearly every County in the State has experienced at least one drought in the past ten years.  Droughts are partly a function of antecedent conditions, so areas that are already experiencing dry conditions are likely to experience more problems when meteorological droughts occur. "

    - "Nature of the Wildfire Hazard in New Jersey  Wildfires represent a serious threat to life, property and natural resources.  The Forest Fire Service was established in 1906 under N.J.S.A. Title 13, Chapter 9, \xE2\x80\x9Cfor the protection of forests, and property adjacent thereto, wherever the department shall determine the necessity therefore\xE2\x80\x9D.  The statute further states that, \xE2\x80\x9CThe Legislature declares it to be the policy of the State to prevent, control, and manage wildfires on or threatening the forest or Wildland of New Jersey in order to preserve forests and other natural resources; to enhance the growth and maintenance of forests; to protect recreational, residential, wildlife, plant life, watershed, airshed, and other values; to promote the stability of forest using industries; and to prevent loss of life, bodily injury and damage to property from wildfire and conflagrations.    The New Jersey Pinelands is a fire adapted forest community that takes advantage of wildfire to reproduce.  The Pinelands are classified as Fuel Model B of the National Fire Danger Rating System with California chaparral and a number of other high hazard types.  Fuel loadings exceed twenty tons per acre in some locales.  This has been equated to having an inch of gasoline covering all of south and central New Jersey.  Pinelands fires burn extremely hot and spread rapidly.  Crown fires are fairly common, spreading from treetop to treetop, as is long range spotting where flying embers start new fires in advance of the main fire."

    - "From the hillside farms and oak forests of northern New Jersey, to the phragmites covered coastal areas along the Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware Bay; and from the state\xE2\x80\x99s core of urban development to the desolation within a sea of trees known as the Pinelands, these vast differences hint at the challenge and difficulties in protecting the state\xE2\x80\x99s citizens from the threat of wildfire.  New Jersey\xE2\x80\x99s high population density has created land use pressures in which more people are moving from urban areas to build homes in rural wildland areas.  With more people living in, and enjoying the state\xE2\x80\x99s wildlands for various forms of recreation, the number of fires started and the seriousness of their consequences increases.  A potentially explosive combination is created when the factors of hazardous wildland fuels, interface home development, and an increased risk of human caused ignition come together under extreme fire weather conditions.  Although many plants in the Pine Barrens ecosystem rely on fire for a part of their reproductive cycle, the homes and property of the people who live there do not.  Although Pinelands fires generally do not cause casualties, property loss can amount to thousands of dollars for each fire.  Although wildfires can occur during all months of the year, spring is the period when the most devastating incidents typically happen.  With the coming of longer days, drying conditions, stronger winds, the weather provides excellent conditions for the rapid spread of fire.  A second \xE2\x80\x9Cseason\xE2\x80\x9D develops in the northern part of the State during the fall when the abundance of freshly fallen leaves provide a bed of fuel for wildfire to race rapidly up the slopes. As shown in Figures 4.4.8.1-1, wildfire locations in the State tend to be in the less developed areas because they are more likely to have sources of fuel for fires, and because detection and suppression are somewhat less likely because there is lower population.

    - One of the most consistent and serious impacts of drought is the contribution to conditions conducive to forest fires.  This applies particularly to the Pine Barrens, where drying conditions favor the combustion of forest fuels.  Generally, a relative humidity of less than 40 percent, winds greater than 13 miles and hour, and precipitation of less than 0.01 inches during a month are ideal conditions for forest fires in the Pine Barrens.  Given the proper conditions, stray cigarette butts, improperly extinguished campfires, and intentional matches can all start fires in the Pine Barrens.  The season of greatest fire threat runs from March through May, though extensive fires have occurred in the summer and autumn months.

    - "The New Jersey Pine Barrens is widely recognized as one of the most hazardous fuel types in the country.  The Pinelands National Reserve is located in the south-central part of New Jersey and has similar wildfire behavior as the chaparral of California.  Recognized for its globally unique fire-dependent ecosystem, the many threatened and endangered plant and animal communities located in the Pine Barrens are protected through the Pinelands Commission, an authority that regulates development within the Reserve.  Within relatively vast areas of this hazardous fuels co-exist many homes in isolated developments that were developed prior to the Pinelands Commission, surrounded by nearly solid development on the perimeter of the Reserve.  This development continues to challenge efforts to reduce the risk of devastating wildfires in New Jersey.  The NJ Forest Fire Service protects a primary response area of 3.25 million acres within the suburban and rural areas of the state.  The goal of the Forest Fire Service is to limit the number of wildfires to less than 2,000 annually, and the acreage burned to less than one half of one percent (0.5%) of the area protected, or 15,750 acres.  The Service accomplishes these goals by maintaining an aggressive fire management program that addresses the hazards and risks unique to each region of the state. "

    - "Fire has played a significant role in the development and distribution of the natural communities found within New Jersey.  The New Jersey Pinelands is a fire adapted forest ecosystem that depends on wildfire for reproduction and the control of fuel buildup. This forest community is one of the most hazardous wildland fuel types in the nation. Additionally,  the oak forests of the north, particularly those found on the slopes of the Appalachian Mountains within the state, produce rapid rates of spread and were once considered a greater threat due to slash piles and scattered debris left after logging for charcoal for furnaces in the late 1800\xE2\x80\x99s.  Phragmites, an invasive grass with its 10 foot height dominating over native species, became established and is a seasonal threat to homes along the \xE2\x80\x9CJersey Shore\xE2\x80\x9D."

The 2007 statewide \xE2\x80\x9CLand Cover/Land Type\xE2\x80\x9D dataset maintained by the NJ Department of Environmental Protection was used as the base map, with each cover type ranked low to extreme.  Where slope exceeds 30%, the rank was assigned the next higher step.  With this image, a better understanding of the location of hazardous fuels can be found.  The frequency and severity of wildfires is dependent on weather and human activity. Nearly all wildfires in New Jersey are human-caused (99%) with arson, children and careless debris burning being the major causes of wildfires. When not promptly controlled, wildfires may grow into catastrophic events. Fire has been a major factor in New Jersey\xE2\x80\x99s environment since prehistoric times.  Natural fires and Native American burning played a major role in shaping the land and providing the vast expanses of forestland that greeted early settlers.

    - "4.4.8.2\tPrevious Wildfire Occurrences in New Jersey  There are a number of early accounts and newspaper stories of fires burning thousands of acres of New Jersey woodlands, causing extensive damage to improved property and untold loss of life. One such account from 1755 reported a fire 30 miles long between Barnegat and Little Egg Harbor. In 1895, John Gifford reported to the state geologist that 49 fires burned 60,000 acres in Burlington, Atlantic and Ocean counties. Other early surveys, including those of 1872 and 1885, indicate that as many as 100,000 to 130,000 acres burned annually in the Pine Barrens region alone.  Figure 4.4-8-1 summarizes historic fires in the State.  New Jersey\xE2\x80\x99s unique geographical and economic position has made it an optimum place to work and live.  The state has over 8.7 million residents in its 8,721 square mile area, making New Jersey the most densely populated state in the nation.  Over 50 % of the state is currently forested with housing developments and individual residences increasingly expanding into forested regions.    "

    - The spread of urbanization into forested regions is known as the wildland urban interface and is defined as the line, area or zone where structures and other human development meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildlands or vegetative fuel.  These resulting wildland urban interface areas pose significant challenges to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service in providing forest fire protection.  Most people across the United States equate wildland urban interface fires with the western portion of the nation, but the potential for significant wildfire activity that threatens human lives and improved property is a reality in New Jersey.  Across New Jersey, any person who lives in a wildland urban interface area is at risk of being threatened or impacted by a wildfire.  Some portions of New Jersey, such as the Pinelands National Reserve and surrounding Pine Barrens region, are more susceptible to serious wildfire occurrences than other areas based on their volatile forest fuels, topographic features, weather patterns and the prevalence of the wildland urban interface encountered there.

    - "Large conflagrations have occurred several times, most recently in 2007.  In 1995, one fire in Ocean County burned 19,225 acres of Pine Barrens forests and a 1997 wildfire burned 800 acres, damaged 52 homes and threatened over 300 homes in Berkeley Township, Ocean County. In 2001, the Jakes Branch wildfire burned over 1,277 acres, destroyed one home, damaged 35 homes and buildings and forced the extended closure of the Garden State Parkway impacting traffic throughout the tri state area on a summer Sunday afternoon. The most notable of New Jersey wildland urban interface wildfires was on the weekend of April 20 \xE2\x80\x93 21, 1963, when a conflagration of wildfires consumed 190,000 acres of forestland; they destroyed 186 homes and 197 buildings and were responsible for the loss of seven civilian lives.  The damage to improved property was estimated at over 8.5 million dollars. The wildfires of 1963 are often cited as a benchmark for fire protection comparisons across the United States."

Since 99% of all forest fires are caused by people, either through carelessness or intentional acts, education is the primary mitigation (http://www.state.nj.us/dep/newsrel/2005/05_0016.htm)   Defining the potential losses by wildfires in New Jersey is difficult.  Weather, the main influence on how a wildfire burns, is a variable that can only be predicted on a short- term basis.  A ten-year average of three major fires (greater than 100 acres) occurs per year, and nearly 1,600 other wildfires burn annually.

    - "Nature of Landslide,   A landslide is a natural geologic process involving the movement of earth materials down a slope, including rock, earth, debris, or a combination of these, under the influence of gravity. However, there are a variety of triggers for landslides such as: a heavy rainfall event, earthquakes, or human activity. The rate of landslide movement ranges from rapid to very slow. A landslide can involve large or small volumes of material. Material can move in nearly intact blocks or be greatly deformed and rearranged. The slope may be nearly vertical or fairly gentle (Delano and Wilshusen, 2001). "

    - Naturally occurring subsidence and sinkholes in New Jersey occur within bands of carbonate bedrock. In northern New Jersey there are more than 225 square miles that are underlain by limestone, dolomite, and marble. In some localities, no sinkholes have appeared, while in others, sinkholes are common. In the southern part of the state there are about 100 square miles which are locally underlain by a limesand with thin limestone layers. No collapse sinkholes have been identified, but there are some features which could be either very shallow solution depressions or wind blowout features. Sinkholes in New Jersey are generally concentrated in the northwestern part of the State, as shown in Figures 4.4.9.4-2, 4.4.9.5-2 and 4.4.9.5-3 The carbonate formations are listed on Figure 4.4.9.5-4.

    - "A sinkhole is a depression in the surface of the ground that results from collapse of the \"roof\" of a \"cave\" in carbonate rocks, or from subsidence of surface material into subsurface openings produced by dissolution of the carbonate bedrock. Cave collapse sinkholes are extremely rare in New Jersey, whereas soil subsidence sinkholes are common. A naturally occurring sinkhole is a closed, usually circular depression in an area underlain by soluble rock which drains internally to the subsurface. Sinkholes generally form along linear trends aligned with fractures and joints in the underlying bedrock.  The fractures occur generally parallel to faults and fold axes within the bedrock. "

    - "Previous Sinkholes and Subsidence  In New Jersey, sinkhole and subsidence activity occurs  primarily in the Counties of Warren, Sussex, Passaic, Morris, Somerset and Hunterdon, which are located along northern and northeastern part of the State. One of the largest documented sinkholes to occur within the State of New Jersey occurred in 1983 in Phillipsburg, Warren County. This hole was large enough to cause a two-story house to rotate on its foundation until the front part of the house had sunk to the second story and the back was ten or more feet off its foundation. A second hole over twenty feet wide opened between the house and the street. All this occurred in a few hours as a result of a broken water main in the street.  On March 17, 2010 a large sinkhole which was 15 feet by 18 feet by 25 feet deep opened up on Brantwood Terrace, in Mansfield Township, Warren County. It took 5 truck loads of concrete to fill the throat of the hole in the bedrock. Then the sinkhole was backfilled with several truckloads of stone and soil.  The 2006, a sinkhole near the New Jersey State Department of Human Resources in Trenton (Figure 4.4.9.4-1) is not a true sinkhole since the area is not underlain by carbonate rock.  . "

    - Incidents of subsidence also have occurred above areas underlain by abandoned mines. About 588 known abandoned mine workings (Figure 4.4.9.4-2) have been documented in the northern part of the state, and the ground above several of these mines has recently collapsed. Examples include mines in Ringwood Borough, Passaic County; Rockaway and Chester Townships, Morris County; Jefferson Township, Morris County; and Bethlehem Township, Hunterdon County. In most instances, the collapse was within a few tens of feet of existing homes. In addition, the collapses in Ringwood, Jefferson and Rockaway Townships threatened sections of heavily-traveled roads, and another collapse in Rockaway Township occurred in the road at the location of a school bus stop (Figure 4.4.9.4-3). Moreover, subsidence has been noted at several mines that are proximal to hiking trails frequented by the general public.

    - Prior mining operations, largely from the 19th century, have left most of the northern part of the state susceptible to subsidence and collapse. The subsurface voids from of most of the old mine workings have either been improperly filled, or were left unfilled after mining ceased. Over the years, soil and rock material have settled or washed into the subsurface voids, causing them to migrate closer to the surface and eventually collapse.  New Jersey Geological Survey geologists and New Jersey Department of Labor and Industry mine safety inspectors have worked collaboratively to investigate incidents of subsidence and collapse and they have concluded that future subsidence should be expected. Based on historic and recent incidents of collapse, the potential for costly property damage and possibly for loss of life as well from additional collapse in the future is a distinct possibility, especially in areas that are more densely populated.

    - Probability of Landslide, Sinkhole and Subsidence Occurrences Landslide probabilities are largely a function of surface geology, but are also influenced by both weather and human activities, as noted above. As part of a HAZUS-based earthquake risk assessment, the NJGS determined landslide susceptibility for seven of the most at-risk Counties in the State, as shown in the series of figures in Appendix W.  Figure 4.4.9.5-1 is an overlay of population density (in gray shades) and landslide susceptibility. The graphic was developed by the New Jersey Geologic Survey.  Although this graphic may be of some use on a regional level, landslides are generally somewhat localized, so better-resolved maps and site-specific engineering and geological data are required for a risk assessment.  As development density increases and spreads throughout the State, the effects of sinkhole and collapse subsidence may become more common.  Homes and other buildings, roads, utilities, water supplies, and septic systems, as well as dams and other engineered structures in areas prone to sinkhole or collapse development are all subject to damage. Figure 4.4.9.5-2 depicts those geologic units that are prone to the development of natural sinkholes. The figure also shows an area in the southern part of the state that is underlain by lime sand, but no significant sinkhole have been identified there to date.

Although sinkholes and subsidence may potentially occur within any area that has carbonate geology, the probability of occurrence is greatest in areas where there is a history of past occurrences. As stated in the previous section, past occurrences have historically been in Warren, Sussex, Morris, Somerset and Hunterdon counties. "

There are at least a few incidences of hail almost every year in the planning area, although for the most part they are minor.  Severity of the Hail Hazard The severity of hailstorms is measured by duration, size of the hail itself, and geographic extent. All of these factors are directly related to the weather phenomena that create the hail, thunderstorms. There is wide potential variation in these severity components. The planning area has a relatively low potential for significant hail events, based on previous records. Impact on Life and Property There are no known instances of injuries or death from hail events in any New Jersey County.  The NCDC database indicates there has been no reported property damage in the State from hail events.  Presumably there are some damages, but most of these are likely addressed by citizens or insurance companies, and therefore there is no readily accessible record of damages.  Damages that do occur are presumably orders of magnitude less than other hazards such as floods or hurricane winds.  Occurrences of the Hail Hazard  The NCDC reported 534 hail events in New Jersey from the period 1950 through 2009.  Some of the noted hail storms occurred in more than one county.  Actual events may be significantly less.   Hailstone sizes ranged in diameter from 0.5\xE2\x80\xB3 to 2.0\xE2\x80\xB3.  Table 4.4.10.4-1 summarizes all New Jersey hail events. "

    - Extreme heat is dangerous and can cause human related illnesses and death.  These illnesses include sunburn, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.  In New Jersey extreme heat is responsible for approximately five deaths annually and overexposure to summer heat causes between 25 and 170 hospitalizations in New Jersey every year, depending on the average outdoor temperature. The majority of those hospitalized for this cause are male, aged 65-84, and are hospitalized for three or more days.    Additionally, less severe cases of heat-related illness send many people to hospital emergency departments or only require treatment at home (New Jersey Department of Health, Health Data Fact Sheet 2005).    Figure 4.4-11-1 shows the trends in heat related hospitalizations from 1995 to 2003.  As temperature goes up so do the number of people hospitalized for heat related illnesses.

Beach restoration and maintenance is an ongoing process for New Jersey. The State legislature provides $25 million annually for beach restoration and every beach on the Atlantic is currently under either a design, engineering or construction phase.  According to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) web site there are 13 Federal coastal engineering projects and 23 State projects that are either in planning, under construction, or recently completed. The Long Branch-Manasquan Project, between Sandy Hook and Manasquan Inlet, is one of the largest beach construction projects completed in the U.S. with over 25 million cubic yards of sand placed on 25 miles of beaches (Source: U.S. Department of Interior).

    - By virtue of their location at the interface between oceans and land, coastal areas are among the most dynamic environments on earth susceptible to a broad range of natural hazards.  Many parts of New Jersey's densely populated coast are highly vulnerable to the effects of flooding, storm surge, episodic erosion, chronic erosion, sea level rise, and extra-tropical storms.   As described in the NJ DEP Coastal management Program web-site, manifestations of these hazards occur at broadly different rates. Their expression ranges from the gradual, such as sea level rise and chronic erosion that can be measured on a decadal time-scale, to catastrophic events like hurricanes, extra-tropical storms, and storm surges that can be measured in terms of days or even hours. Just as their rates of occurrence differ, so are their effects expressed in profoundly different ways.

In New Jersey, construction of new residential development, reconstruction of existing residential development, and the conversion of single family dwellings into multi-unit dwellings continue in hazardous areas. Although application of more stringent construction standards and techniques results in more storm-resistant structures, the value of property at risk has appreciably increased. With anticipated accelerating sea level rise and increasing storm frequency and intensity, vulnerability to the risks of coastal hazards will be exacerbated and the costs of damages and losses resulting from the events will increase. Catastrophic events require anticipatory preparations for the inevitability of an event, the capacity for rapid response to an imminent threat of an event, and preparation for addressing the aftermath of an event."

Based on the trend of sea level rise from 1961 through 2003, sea level would rise by almost 6-inches by the end of this century in the absence of any effects of climate change. Taking climate change into account, sea level is projected to rise between 7 and 21 inches by 2100. This increase would result in the threat of more sustained extreme storm surges, increased coastal erosion, escalating inundation of coastal wetlands and saline intrusion. The Grant F.

Although this storm did not produce record surge levels, it inflicted substantially greater overall damages and loss of life than any other storm. This was primarily due to the prolonged duration of the storm that caused damaging overwash and flooding through five successive high tides. Increased development along the coast since the 1944 hurricane also accounted for increased damages. This storm was also responsible for the loss of 22 lives, completely destroyed 1,853 homes and caused major damage to approximately 2,000 additional homes. The total damage caused by this storm to public and private property was about $85 million (1962 dollars)."

It is difficult, if not impossible, to assign a probability to the near constant small ongoing erosion that may occur over a continuous period of time.  However, a probability can be assigned to larger storm events such as Nor\xE2\x80\x99easter\xE2\x80\x99s and Hurricanes which can result in significant storm induced coastal erosion. As described in the sections above related to Nor\xE2\x80\x99easters and Hurricanes, the probabilities of these events range from a few a year (Nor\xE2\x80\x99easters) to less than one significant event per decade on average (hurricanes).

    - "4.4.14.2  Civil Unrest \tCivil disorder, also known as civil unrest or civil strife, is a broad term that is typically used by law enforcement to describe one or more forms of disturbance caused by a group of people.  Civil disturbance is typically a symptom of, and a form of protest against, major socio-political problems; the severity of the action coincides with public expression(s) of displeasure. Examples of civil disorder include, but are not necessarily limited to: illegal parades; sit-ins and other forms of obstructions; riots; sabotage; and other forms of crime. It is intended to be a demonstration to the public and the government, but can escalate into general chaos.   Frequently, participants in a civil disorder are not in agreement about appropriate behavior. As was the case in the WTO Meeting of 1999, most protesters were peaceful, and a small, highly visible minority were responsible for most of the damage. Any civil disorder is a delicate balance of power, and indeed, a political power struggle of some sort is typically the root cause of any such conflict. Often, public demonstrations are viewed as the last resort of political organizations. If the power equation in a civil disorder becomes unbalanced, the result is either oppression or riot.  Citizens not directly involved in a civil disorder may have their lives significantly disrupted. Their ability to work, enjoy recreation and in some cases, obtain necessities may be jeopardized. Disruption of infrastructure may occur during very severe events. Public utilities such as water, fuel and electricity may be temporarily unavailable, as well as public infrastructure for communication. Occasionally, the disruption of such services may be the original cause of the disorder.  More frequently, the cause of such issues is related to economic stagnation, severe inflation, devaluation of currency, disasters man made or natural, severe unemployment, oppression, political scandal, or, in some countries, sporting events. Civil disorder can occur in any country and environment. Switzerland, a country known for its neutrality suffered from much civil unrest in the weeks prior to its October 2007 elections. There were many reports of injuries and destruction and criminal charges are still pending.

    - "4.4.14.8 Nuclear Hazard    Issues \tA nuclear and radiation accident is usually defined as a loss of control of radioactive material with the potential to cause radiation poisoning.  Nuclear accidents (a term defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency's International Nuclear Event Scale) are much larger in magnitude of effects than a typical radiation accident. The prime example of a \"major nuclear accident\" is one in which a reactor core is damaged and large amounts of radiation are released, such as in the Chernobyl Disaster in 1986. An example of a radiation accident might be some event such as a radiography accident where a worker drops the radioactive source into a river but quickly retrieves it.  Radiation accidents are far more common than nuclear accidents, and are often limited in scale. For instance at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center, a worker overrode safety procedures and entered a room containing a Cobalt-60 irradiation source. Though the worker received a fatal dose, no one else was exposed.

    - "4.4.14.10 Power Outages \tA power outage (also known as a power cut, power failure, power loss, or blackout) is a short- or long-term loss of the electric power to an area.  There are many causes of power failures in an electricity network. Examples of these causes include, faults at power stations, damage to power lines, substations or other parts of the distribution system, a short circuit, or the overloading of electricity mains.  Blackout power outages are categorized into three different phenomena, relating to the duration and effect of the outage: \xE2\x80\xA2\tA transient fault is a momentary (a few seconds) loss of power typically caused by a temporary fault on a power line. Power is automatically restored once the fault is cleared.  \xE2\x80\xA2\tA brownout or sag is a drop in voltage in an electrical power supply. The term brownout comes from the dimming experienced by lighting when the voltage sags.  \xE2\x80\xA2\tA blackout refers to the total loss of power to an area and is the most severe form of power outage that can occur. Blackouts which result from or result in power stations tripping are particularly difficult to recover from quickly. Outages may last from a few minutes to a few weeks depending on the nature of the blackout and the configuration of the electrical network.  \xE2\x80\xA2\t Power failures are particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk. Institutions such as hospitals, sewage treatment plants, mines, etc., will usually have backup power sources, such as standby generators, which will automatically start up when electrical power is lost. Other critical systems, such as telecommunications, are also required to have emergency power. Telephone exchange rooms usually have arrays of lead-acid batteries for backup and also a socket for connecting a generator during extended periods of outage.  The effects of trying to mitigate cascading failures near the critical point in an economically feasible fashion are often shown to not be beneficial and often even detrimental. Four mitigation methods have been tested using the OPA blackout mode: 1.\tIncrease critical number of failures causing cascading blackouts - Shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts.  2.\tIncrease individual power line max load \xE2\x80\x93 Shown to increase the frequency of smaller blackouts and decrease that of larger blackouts.  3.\tCombination of increasing critical number and max load of lines \xE2\x80\x93 Shown to have no significant effect on either size of blackout. The resulting minor reduction in the frequency of blackouts is projected to not be worth the cost of the implementation.  4.\tIncrease the excess power available to the grid \xE2\x80\x93 Shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts.  5.\t In addition to the finding of each mitigation strategy having a cost-benefit relationship with regards to frequency of small and large blackouts, the total number of blackout events was not significantly reduced by any of the above mentioned mitigation measures.

    - "4.4.14.11 Terrorism \tTerrorism is, in the most general sense, the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion.  At present, the International community has been unable to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism.   Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts which are intended to create fear (terror), are perpetrated for an ideological goal (as opposed to a lone attack), and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (civilians). Some definitions also include acts of unlawful violence and war. The history of terrorist organizations suggests that they do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness.  Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives, which are often murky and undefined.  The word \"terrorism\" is politically and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \xE2\x80\x9Cterrorism\xE2\x80\x9D.  The concept of terrorism may itself be controversial as it is often used by state authorities to de-legitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may itself be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state.). A less politically and emotionally charged, and more easily definable, term is violent non-state actor[ (though the semantic scope of this term includes not only \"terrorists,\" while excluding some individuals or groups who have previously been described as \"terrorists\").[ Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations for furthering their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments.   One form is the use of violence against noncombatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual.

      	The SNS Security and Transportation Tabletop Exercise was a success. Though it fostered communication between SERT partners and representatives from the counties, more communications plans and information sharing is encouraged. Participants followed along with the Participant or Evaluator Logs and were fully engaged in discussion. Though the room was small, sound was good and everyone could hear. Recommend allotting at least four to six hours for future tabletop exercises on SNS-related topics. This will provide more time to digest and provide details. &quot;Action exercises&quot; and less planning are needed in order to determine what can or may not work. Plans that are developed or revised should include review by local partners and then updating them to mesh with county Emergency Operations Plans. Direct local involvement and perspective with law enforcement, emergency management and public health on this subject are needed.</p>

      	The National Weather Service has posted a Winter Storm Watch for the western two-thirds of North Carolina from Friday (18 Dec) to Sunday (20 Dec) night.&nbsp; The system hit the mountains through that time period and slowly tapered off by December 20.</p>

    - |
      <p>
      	Winter Weather Advisories and Winter Storm Warnings&nbsp;were issued for&nbsp;the western two-thirds of North Carolina until late on 19 December. Winter precipitation&nbsp;was expected, for the most part, west of US Highway 1. As much as 18 inches of snow was anticipated in the northern Mountains, between 12 and 15 inches in the central Mountains, and lesser amounts in the southern Mountains. The northwestern Piedmont was predicted to receive 8 to 14 inches with amounts decreasing to the east and southeast. Freezing rain and drizzle is expected overnight and during the day tomorrow.&nbsp; Maximum accumulation were expected to be just west of I85, but even there should be less than &frac14; inch. Wind gusts and snow and ice on roadways caused hazardous driving conditions, and power outages resulted from a combination of wet snow, freezing rain and high winds.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	As the system continued to move away to the Northeast and produced a decent 2-4 inches additional overnight.&nbsp; Advisory&nbsp;was issued for Macon, Jackson and Buncombe. The snow should taper off in the afternoon east of the mountains</p>

    - 48 hours
    - |
      <p>
      	Exercise was conducted over a 48 hour period with Day 1 beginning with an IAP brief on flooding with two counties in the western part of NC activating EOC.&nbsp; Day 2 beginis with a hurricane 72 hours from landfall and ends 24 hours before landfall</p>

    - |
      <p>
      	Two main events dictate play.&nbsp; The first event has Western North Carolina responding to the remnants of a Gulf Coast hurricane that causes severe flooding and wind damage. The hurricane makes landfall in Mississippi, then moves north along the Blue Ridge Mountains, bringing more than 8 inches or rain in a 24-hour perios to the western counties of North Carolina on May 17, 2008.&nbsp; the State Emergency Response Team (SERT) is fully activated, and special teams, equipment, material and commodities are supporting the western counties.</p>
      <p>
      	The second event centers on 120 to 24 hours before another hurricance making ladfall.&nbsp; On May 17, 2008 the National Hurrican Center (NHC) gives the name Hurrex of a Category 4 hurricance heading northwest off the southeastern coast of Cuba.&nbsp; The NHC predicts ladfall between Myrtle Beach, SC and Virginia Beach, VA, not later than May 24.&nbsp; On May 29, the NHC narrow the landfall predeiction to between Little River, NC and Ocracoke Island, NC.&nbsp; The SERT focuses its attention on a coastal evacuation between landfall minus 120 hours and landfall minus 24 hours.</p>
      <p>
      	On Day 1, exercise play commences with an IAP brief, which brings all participants up to speed on both events (e.g. allocation of State assets in the west, weather, hurricane track).&nbsp; Two counties in the western region of NC, Macon and Henderson Counties, activates their EOCs and focus on recovery and development of an IAP in relation to the western flooding.&nbsp; These counties interact with the State EOC.&nbsp; In regards to Hurrex, participants on Day 1 discuss ESF-1, ESF-6, and ESF-12 operations and end with the development of an IAP.</p>
      <p>
      	Day 2 activies in the western part of the State focus on the use of Incident Management Teams (IMT).&nbsp; For the eastern portion of the scenario, Day 2 begins with Hurrex 72 hours from landfall and ends 24 hours before landfall.&nbsp; The activities primarily focus on State and local EOC evacuation and shelter operations.&nbsp; The North Carolina Office of Emergency Services conducts a TTX in the morning concerning FMSS transporation and shelter operations covering the peiord of 96 to 24 hours before landfall.</p>
      <p>
      	Three counties (i.e. Carteret, New Hanover, and Onslow) in the eastern region of NC test evacuation and transportation of patients who cannot transport themselves out of harm&#39;s way.&nbsp; In-county assets are used in the transportation aspect of the exercise.</p>
      <p>
      	While person in at-risk counties are not physically transported to the host counties during the exercise, two host counties (i.e Harnett and Johnston) set up shelters during the exercise.&nbsp; In addition, Moore County moved County Animal Mobile Equipment Teams (CAMET) into Harnett County.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harnett County opens a collocation shelter, while Johnston County uses a drop-off shelter for animals.</p>

      	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>The Strategic National Stockpile Request for Assets is required in the Local Technical Assistance Review (LTAR) written by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Division of SNS (DSNS).&nbsp; A requirement of DSNS is to exercise all elements of the LTAR within a three year cycle if possible.&nbsp; NC PHPR determined that because this portion of the LTAR had not been exercised within the past two years an exercise would be conducted to evaluate readiness.&nbsp; In years past Full Scale Exercises (FSE) were conducted at the direction of PHPR and in coordination with the regional PHRSTs that complimented this component included in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HurrEX2010 FSE.&nbsp; These exercises included SNS Mass Dispensing and SNS Distribution.&nbsp; Funding was provided for the planning and conduct of the SNS Requests for Asset FSE Component by CDC&rsquo;s Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement.&nbsp; The aim for was to encourage hospitals/other health care facilities in partnership with local Public Health and Emergency Management to assess emergency medical supplies that might be needed in anticipation of a hurricane.&nbsp; Hospitals and LHDs would be asked to evaluate what caches were available within their counties and regions and what emergency medical supplies would be needed in addition to their own supplies that should be ordered through the State as Federal assets from SNS.&nbsp; In addition, inter-agency communication was critical in coordinating Requests for Assistance through local EM to the State.</p>

      	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>During this operations-based exercise, the following scenario and secondary situation was presented to players.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	HurrEX2010 SNS Request for Assets FSE Component involved a natural disaster.&nbsp; The scenario was triggered by a major hurricane approaching South Eastern North Carolina that could result in catastrophic wind and subsequent flood damage similar to Hurricane Floyd (the third major hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season that triggered the third largest evacuation in US history when 2.6 million coastal residents of five states, including NC, were ordered from their homes as it approached).&nbsp; A secondary situation was the anticipated disruption of just-in-time medical supply lines to local public health and medical/other health care facilities.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	<u>Participant Briefing Scenario</u> &ndash; Sent to all participating agency Primary Contacts via email. &ldquo;By May 3rd, which is Landfall -2, the hurricane has strengthened to a mid-Category IV.&nbsp; Landfall is expected overnight on May 4th as a low-Category IV storm, tracking over central and eastern NC.&nbsp; Heavy snow and rain throughout the winter and spring are contributing to major river basins being at or near flood stage.&nbsp; Heavy thunderstorms and tornadoes could create a situation similar to Hurricane Floyd or worse.&nbsp; As a participating agency discuss equipment and medical supply needs to sustain services if your supply chain is cut-off for a week or more. In anticipation of a disruption in your supply chain make a &ldquo;Request for Assistance&rdquo; according to your emergency response plan. Coordination and communication with local partners are essential.&quot;</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	StartEx Inject Message Sent to hospital/medical facility Primary Contacts as a test alert using the State Medical Asset Resource Tracking Tool (SMARTT) -- &quot;HURREX2010&nbsp;EXERCISE MESSAGE. North Carolina Public Health Preparedness and Response is requesting all local health departments and hospitals, or other medical facilities, consider emergency supplies and medical inventory needed to sustain operations in the event they cannot receive them for a week to 10 days. A Request for Assistance should be submitted today in anticipation of the hurricane currently two days from landfall in eastern and central regions of our state. Flooding could impact other counties across western North Carolina. THIS IS AN EXERCISE MESSAGE.&quot;</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Planned Simulations: Because HurrEX2010 FSE was directed at only parts of eastern and central counties of North Carolina, not all local Emergency Managers elected to participate in the exercise and/or the SNS Request for Assets exercise component.&nbsp;Alternate means was in place whereby a local request for assistance (RFA) from a hospital/health care facility or health department could be entered into the NCSPARTA&rsquo;s WebEOC web based system from NC Emergency Management Regional Coordination Centers (RCC) if local emergency managers were unavailable.&nbsp; If an RCC was unavailable to take a request, the back-up plan was the use of PHRST Controllers that would receive the RFA via email or fax, review, approve and notify the requesting agency&rsquo;s primary contact of their request status.&nbsp; It should be noted that in an actual natural disaster the simulation would not be used as all RCCs and affected local emergency management services would be activated and staffed as long as necessary to provide response and recovery operations.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	A second simulation was the creation of a &ldquo;Virtual Public Health Coordination Center&nbsp;(PHCC).&rdquo;&nbsp; The PHCC is located in the Cooper Building in downtown Raleigh, NC.&nbsp; However, during this exercise an effort was made to use Public Health Liaisons at the Human Services Branch of the State Emergency Operations Center in Raleigh to assign RFA for SNS assets to PHCC Liaisons that were actually PHRST members located in their host counties across the state provided login privileges to access NCSPARTA&rsquo;s WebEOC Task boards.&nbsp; Requests accepted by the Liaisons in the Virtual PHCC (e.g., PHRST members) accepted, reviewed, approved, and notified SNS request for asset Primary Contacts at the participating agencies.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
      	The 45th Democratic National Convention (DNC) was held in Denver, Colorado from August 25 to August 28, 2008. The DNC brought unprecedented worldwide attention to the City of Denver. An estimated 35,000 participants attended the convention, including 15,000 national and international media representatives. The DNC provided the stage from which thousands of individuals could voice their political views through mass gatherings, parades and protests.</p>
      <div>
      	The Pepsi Center served as the primary location for DNC events from August 25 to 27; the acceptance speech by the nominee was held on August 28 at Invesco Field at Mile High. Several additional events were held at venues throughout the downtown area and neighboring cities.</div>
      <div>
      	The DNC and the associated events presented the City of Denver with the highest levels of security challenges to ensure the safety of visitors and citizens, and the protection of public infrastructures and private business properties. As a National Special Security Event (NSSE), the United States Secret Service (USSS) served as the Lead Federal Agency (LFA); the Denver Police Department (DPD) was designated as the Local Lead Agency (LLA). The USSS and DPD established 17 DNC planning subcommittees comprised of Federal, state and local agencies that developed and implemented a comprehensive DNC Safety and Security Plan.</div>
      <div>
      	The success of the 2008 DNC was the result of sixteen months of careful planning, training and preparation. This planning process resulted in a seamless, comprehensive operation that ensured the security of the DNC and preservation of public safety. This exceptional effort resulted in the effective and efficient preparation, communication and response during the DNC that enabled lawful protest and protected First Amendment rights while sustaining the protection and safety of all citizens and property.</div>

      	The Zen Fire Service Institute, the State Fire Academy, is charged with providing ODP approved training to the rostered Team members. In an effort to assess the effectiveness of the training, as well as the ability of the Teams to deploy from their local region, ZFSI was again charged by the ZTTF, to develop an annual validation of Teams, to be conducted at the ZFSI training campus in Zen, Zen.</p>
      <p>
      	Zen Fire Service Institute in conjunction with the Mutual Aid System &ldquo;MAS&rdquo;, Technical Rescue Teams Steering Committee. Designed a Full Scale Exercise for a tornado to devastate the training grounds at the Zen Fire Service Institutes Zen campus.</p>

    - |
      <p>
      	The exercise was created to have a natural weather related incident take place in a community that is simulated on the training grounds of the Zen Fire Service Institute Zen campus. This community consists of props to simulate a three story multi-unit apartment building, a concrete and heavy steel office complex, and a medical facility. A tornado has touched down causing extensive damage to the site. The responding Teams were required to report to a remote reception location, where base line medical information was gathered and administrative paperwork completed to include credentialing. They then reported to the exercise site, where they were briefed on the situation, given work assignments and BOO location. The total exercise ran approximately 33 hours with each Team working approximately 26 hours, with 7 hours down time.&nbsp; Prior to the Teams returning to their respective quarters, they were debriefed by both ZFSI and MAS evaluators</p>

      <p>
      	Executive Summary</p>
      <p>
      	The Northern Zen University shootings took place on February 14, 2008, during which a gunman shot multiple people on the campus of Northern Zen University&nbsp;in Tranquil, Zen, killing six and wounding eighteen.</p>
      <p>
      	The incident happened on the campus&#39;s Cole Hall at approximately 3:05 p.m. local time.&nbsp; The school placed the campus on lockdown; students and teachers were advised to head to a secure location, take cover, and avoid the scene and all buildings in the vicinity of the area.&nbsp; Six people died in the incident, including the perpetrator, making it the fourth-deadliest university shooting in United States history.</p>
      <p>
      	A memorial service for the victims of the shootings was scheduled for Sunday, February 24, 2008 at the NZU Convocation Center.&nbsp; NZU police were concerned that with all of the media attention and Wesboro Church directed attention, that the memorial service could be a magnet for a person looking to create a significant event.&nbsp; The university police requested a detail from the SWMDT to provide air monitoring prior to and during the memorial service.&nbsp; Such a detail was comprised of 12 members of the SWMDT Science Element.&nbsp; All members of the detail were employees of various state agencies.&nbsp; ZMERT was deployed to provide medical assistance to the SWMDT and other state assets during the deployment to NZU.</p>
      <p>
      	The following objectives were developed for the NZU deployment.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
      	Objective 1: Notify ZMERT team members of the event; provide deployment instructions; and establish a strike team ready for deployment.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
      	Objective 2: Establish an initial patient care area in the assigned location within NZU, with the capability of rapid deployment to another site.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
      	Objective 3: Establish communications between ZMERT, SWMDT Command, and other responders.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
      	Objective 4: Monitor deployment activity and maintain situational awareness using established resource-tracking systems (Groove, etc.).</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
      	Objective 5: Demobilize ZMERT equipment and personnel in a safe and controlled manner.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The purpose of this report is to analyze the deployment results, identify strengths to be maintained and built upon, identify potential areas for further improvement and support development of corrective actions.</p>
      <p>
      	<strong>Major Strengths</strong></p>
      <p>
      	The major strengths identified during this exercise are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>
      		Patient care area established within boiler room at NZU and a rapid deployment team was established.</li>
      	<li>
      		ZMERT personnel were briefed on the mission, the ZMERT evacuation site and response procedures developed for this deployment.</li>
      	<li>
      		ZMERT was able to maintain situational awareness using the Groove workspace created for this deployment.</li>
      	<li>
      		All equipment and personnel were demobilized safely.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	<strong>Primary Areas for Improvement</strong></p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Throughout the deployment, opportunities for improvement for ZMERT to respond to incidents in the State of Zen were identified.&nbsp; The primary areas for improvement, including recommendations, are as follows:</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>
      		ZMERT staff and volunteers received incorrect information about the pre-determined staging area and reporting time.</li>
      	<li>
      		There was confusion about which ZMERT teams and equipment were required for the deployment.</li>
      	<li>
      		There was confusion about ZMERT responsibility in relation to dignitaries and civilians attending the memorial service.</li>
      	<li>
      		Communications with SWMDT Command and other responders was not established.&nbsp; 800 MHZ radio (including Starcom21), cell phones, and VHF radios had spotty coverage within the structures at NZU.</li>
      	<li>
      		Attempts to resolve communication issues using an VTEC&rsquo;s radio system were not successful.&nbsp; ZMERT did not have the cables needed for the ICRI box in order to patch frequencies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	This deployment experience was successful in addressing the process that ZMERT would follow if deployed in the State of Zen in the event of a mass casualty situation that would require the utilization of an alternate care site.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">
      	ZMERT assets were pre-deployed to NZU to provide medical support for SWMDT and other state assets as required during the memorial service for the victims of the NZU shootings.&nbsp; ZMERT&rsquo;s medical package and personnel were pre-staged in the boiler room of NZU.&nbsp; ZMERT staff were instructed to wear civilian clothing instead of ZMERT uniforms, to limit the size of the deployment team, and to deploy only with trucks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      	The Storm of April 15-16, 2007<br />
      	Low pressure developed over Texas on Friday the 13th, it moved across the Tennessee River Valley on Saturday, April 14th, and over the lower Appalachians on Saturday night. The low continued to intensify as it drifted to the northeast, passing off the Virginia Capes late on Sunday, April 15th. The center of the storm moved northward over the coastal waters of Delaware and New Jersey on Sunday night before reaching the New York City area on Monday morning, April 16th.<br />
      	Heavy rain began to fall in much of eastern Pennsylvania, northeastern Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey late on Saturday night. The precipitation began as a period of light snow in the higher elevations of the Pocono region before changing to rain on Sunday morning.<br />
      	The heavy rain continued through the day on Sunday and into Sunday night. Rainfall totals ranged from 3 to 7 inches in the region. Totals were slightly lower along the New Jersey coast, where they were mainly between 2 and 4 inches.<br />
      	The heavy rain resulted in widespread flooding. Most of eastern Pennsylvania and the far upper Delmarva region had been under a flood watch since Friday afternoon, along with northern, central and southwestern New Jersey. Southeastern New Jersey, central and southern Delaware, and the rest of northeastern Maryland were added to the flood watch around noontime on Saturday. The first flood warnings were issued in the early morning hours of Sunday.<br />
      	A number of locations experienced near record flooding. Around noontime on Monday, the Raritan River crested at Bound Brook at 38.4 feet, the second highest on record. On Monday afternoon, the Millstone River crested at Blackwells Mills at 19.2 feet, the second highest on record. Also on Monday afternoon, the Assunpink Creek crested at Trenton at 13.3 feet, the fourth highest on record. On Tuesday night, the Passaic River crested at Little Falls at 11.9 feet, the third highest on record.<br />
      	The heavy rain resulted in significant rises along the main stem of the Delaware River. However, the river crested just below flood stage at most locations on Monday night.<br />
      	In addition to the flooding on streams, creeks and rivers, there was tidal flooding along the coasts of New Jersey and Delaware, along Delaware Bay and on the tidal portion of the Delaware River. There was widespread minor tidal flooding for a number of tide cycles, beginning on Sunday evening, especially along the New Jersey shore.<br />
      	As cold air began to wrap around the storm and into the region on Sunday night and Monday, the rain changed to snow at many locations. Parts of Carbon, Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Berks, Chester, Montgomery, Bucks and Delaware Counties in Pennsylvania picked up an inch or two of snow early on Monday morning. Many location from Philadelphia south and east, as well as parts of northern and central New Jersey, received anywhere from a trace to an inch of snow at that time. Meanwhile, in the higher elevations of the Poconos, mainly above 1500 feet, up to 4 to 7 inches of snow fell from Sunday night into Monday.<br />
      	The strongest winds associated with the storm were on the morning of the 16th as the low moved up over the New York City area. Peak wind gusts were generally in the 40 to 50 mph range in New Jersey, Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland. Gusts were a little higher along the coast and near Delaware Bay, mainly from 50 to 60 mph.<br />
      	A record low barometric pressure for the month of April was recorded at Philadelphia. The pressure bottomed out at 28.82 inches at 4:33 am on Monday. The previous record was 28.91 inches set on April 2, 1970.</p>

      	New Jersey&rsquo;s strategy incorporates the capabilities-based planning model from the Federal government, including all (37) Target Capabilities activities and critical tasks.&nbsp; The Urban Search and Rescue Unit of the New Jersey State Police (NJSP), Homeland Security Branch is the program manager for the Metro Urban Search and Rescue (MUSAR) Strike Team system within the UASI region.&nbsp; An objective of the State&rsquo;s Homeland Security Strategy, Goal III Respond to Incidents of Terrorism Quickly and Effectively, Objective (2), identifies the need to enhance New Jersey&rsquo;s first responder preparedness using the Preparedness Cycle:&nbsp; Organize, Train, &amp; Equip;&nbsp; Exercise; and Evaluate &amp; Improve.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The primary purpose of this exercise was to measure, evaluate and validate performance of the NJ-TF1 &ldquo;Blue Team&rsquo;s&rdquo; capabilities.&nbsp; This full scale exercise allowed for the assessment of the NJ-TF1 &ldquo;Blue Team&rsquo;s&rdquo; knowledge, skills and abilities to effectively and efficiently respond to a transportation disaster. &nbsp;<br />
      	<br />
      	The implementation strategy for the full scale exercise was designed by an exercise committee comprised of State Police personnel from the USAR Unit and tunnel planners from the Center for National Response/Joint Interagency Education and Training in Standard, West Virginia.&nbsp; The guidance provided by the USAR Unit ensured that the exercise would comport with the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) which utilizes adult learning principles, including problem-based learning. This committee quickly developed a consensus on the plan for the full scale exercise.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
      	The exercise plan calls for the NJ-TF1 &ldquo;Blue Team&rdquo; to be bused down to the Center for National Response/Joint Interagency Education and Training in Standard, West Virginia Center to participate in a thirty-two hour vehicular tunnel collapse simulation.&nbsp; This training venue is a non-operational two lane highway tunnel approximately over 2,800 feet long.&nbsp; The venue can be used for several different scenarios.&nbsp; It is designed to simulate collapsed train and subway tunnels, or collapsed parking garages, buildings, etc.&nbsp; This tunnel can be made to resemble a terrorist initiated event or a natural disaster, such as an earthquake. In this case, the incident will be characterized to the responding personnel as an incident where a vehicle borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) was detonated in a vehicular tunnel linking New York and New Jersey during the morning rush hour.&nbsp; The tunnel will be blocked near the center with rubble and wrecked vehicles.&nbsp; The tunnel will be packed with slabs of concrete and vehicles.&nbsp; Live radiation sources will be placed throughout the tunnel to simulate remnants of a possible dirty bomb explosion.&nbsp; Live victims and numerous mannequin dummies will be strategically placed throughout the debris field.</p>

      		Approximately 7 Million without power in New Jersey and 13 Million additional throughout the NYC metro area</li>
      	<li>
      		Approximately 900,000 citizens over 65 in age and 450,000 children under 5 years old without power</li>
      	<li>
      		As a result of power outages, surge and wind damage throughout the impact area: water distribution, natural gas systems and sewage treatment systems are inoperable with heavy surge related structural damage in the counties of Middlesex, Hudson, Essex and Bergen Counties.</li>

      	The purpose of<strong> GOV Hurricane</strong> TTX is to provide officials and key personnel an opportunity to evaluate preparedness concepts, policies, plans, procedures, and capabilities during a hurricane. The intent is to provide an opportunity to refine overall response and decision-making processes as well as integration and coordination among responding public health, emergency management, public safety agencies, and private industry enterprises.</p>
      <p>
      	The major outcome of the exercise was the identified need to develp contra flow plans for the Garden State Parkway in Atlantic and Cape May Counties to facilitate evacuations from those areas.&nbsp; Contra flow plans for those counties were subsequently completed in 2008, and have been revised since that time. &nbsp;</p>

      	A developing winter storm has the potential to drop heavy snow across the watch area from late Wednesday through Friday. A swath of one foot snow is possible within the watch area. The greatest chances of this occurring at this time are across the eastern shore of Maryland, Delaware, and southern New Jersey. If this would materialize, and it is not a certainty at this time, it would be the heaviest snow in Delmarva and southeast New Jerseysince the January 1987 and February 1989 snowstorms.</p>
      <p>
      	A winter storm watch means the potential exists for heavy snow in the watch area. This is not a certainty at the moment. Persons should use today to make necessary preparations in the event a winter storm warning issuance becomes necessary later today. Bear in mind that travel could become almost impossible on Thursday.</p>
      <p>
      	<strong>Wednesday, January 24, 2007</strong><strong>- </strong><strong>10:30am</strong></p>
      <p>
      	A winter storm warning is in effect for eastern Pennsylvania, all of New Jersey, Delaware, and northeastern Maryland. A winter storm warning means that heavy snow of 6 inches or more for the southern Pocono&rsquo;s, the Lehigh Valley, and northern New Jersey of 4 inches or more over southern New Jersey, extreme southeast Pennsylvania, Delaware, and northeast Maryland and will occur within 12 to 24 hours.</p>
      <p>
      	Snow is forecast to develop over northeastern Maryland, Delaware, southern Pennsylvania, and southern New Jerseygenerally overnight accumulating a couple of inches by daybreak. The heaviest snow is expected for later Thursday and Thursday night as the storm&rsquo;s energy will be the greatest at that time.</p>

      	A blizzard warning has been issued for later today through Friday morning for much of the southern portion of Pennsylvaniaincluding the southern portions of the SusquehannaValley, all of New Jersey, all of Delaware, and northeastern Maryland. A blizzard warning means that sustained winds of 35 MPH or greater are expected along with falling and/or blowing snow frequently reducing visibility to less than &frac14; mile. Northeast winds will become quite strong later today possibly as high as 30 to 40 MPH with gusts around 50 MPH along the coast. <em>This will create blizzard conditions later today and tonight and significant blowing and drifting of snow will occur. The heaviest snow with amounts of around 2 feet are likely to occur from northeastern Maryland and Delaware through southeastern Pennsylvania and most of New Jersey</em>. <em>This storm has the potential to be the heaviest snow on record in a large part of the warning area, especially in </em><em>Philadelphia</em><em>, </em><em>Atlantic City</em><em>, and </em><em>Wilmington</em><em>.</em></p>

      	A significant weather event hit the State of New Jersey from March 10-11, 2011 depositing a significant amount of rainfall ranging from 2-5 inches in some places. The Passaic River basin was inundated with flooding and a number of communities were affected. In preparation of this event Governor Chris Christie declared a State of Emergency which allowed the state to pre-position resources in order to respond to this event.&nbsp; At 6:00 AM, Thursday, March 10, 2011, the NJROIC operational level increased to Level III.&nbsp; The SEOC worked closely with the National Weather Service throughout this entire event, and relied on them to provide timely briefings and updates to SEOC Command.&nbsp; Based on the Level III Operational status, and the anticipation of resources being requested and deployed, an additional member was added to the original SEOC schedule.&nbsp; At any given time the SEOC Operations and Support room were staffed by representatives from the following agencies: NJOEM, Special Operations, Field Operations, FEMA, NJDHSS, NJDFS, NJDMAVA, NJDOT, NJBPU, NJDHS, Salvation Army, American Red Cross, and NJDEP.&nbsp; Throughout the activation, flooding and river gages were closely monitored and maps were supplied by our GIS specialists.&nbsp; Resources were requested and deployed in response to this event and mandatory evacuations were ordered. Sheltering operations and feeding operations were established by the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army.&nbsp; The NJROIC returned to Level I operations on March 15 which allowed NJOEM to begin the preliminary damage assessment process with our FEMA partners in the hopes of obtaining Federal Assistance through a Presidential Disaster Declaration.</p>

      	Flood warnings and advisories have been issued throughout New Jersey for the weekend for several counties, including Atlantic, Burlington, Cape May, Cumberland, Essex, Hudson, Monmouth, Ocean, and Union counties.<br />
      	In a pattern more reminiscent of winter, a nor&rsquo;easter is forecast to track northward just off the East Coast the end of this week and into the weekend. It&rsquo;s a little early in the year for this storm to produce the intense snow often associated with a nor&rsquo;easter, but plenty of rain and cooler temperatures along much of the eastern seaboard is expected.&nbsp; Mountainous areas might see a little snow as well.<br />
      	The low pressure center that will become the storm is currently situated over the Mississippi/Tennessee border. It will move eastward and off the South Carolina coast by tomorrow morning before turning northeastward and racing up the coast. (Note: the Nor&rsquo;easter is given its&rsquo; name not because it moves northeast or often affects the northeast US; rather, it usually produces northeast winds along the coast as it passes by, producing heavy precipitation.)<br />
      	It appears the heaviest rain will fall in the mid-Atlantic states during the day on Thursday. Around an inch of rain can be expected from Washington, DC to New York, NY, with the heaviest rain (1.5+ inches) falling in Delaware and southern New Jersey. The chance of precipitation will continue through the weekend for much of the east coast with the probability of rain diminishing each day. The 5-day rain totals (ending Monday morning &ndash; see map below) could exceed 3 inches in parts of eastern PA, NJ, DE, MD, and southern NY.<br />
      	This event could mark the 2nd-earliest snowfall on record in the region as the forecast is for at least 4 inches of snow between Thursday morning and Friday morning:<br />
      	Colder-than-normal temperatures are forecast along much of the east coast. As the nor&rsquo;easter moves northward, cold, Canadian air will move southward on the west side of the storm and settle into much of the eastern US. Average temperatures will run about 15 degrees below normal with high temperatures struggling to hit the 50 degree mark on Thursday and Friday. (As a reference, the average high in Washington, DC this time of year is in the upper-60s. New York City usually tops out in the low- to mid-60s.)</p>

    - "2007-09-06"
    - "2007-10-24"
    - Two separate exercises 8 hours total
    - |
      <p>
      	The Monster of Rock exercise series (tabletop and functional) was developed to evaluate Public Safety and Security Response, Communications, and Explosive Device Response Operations capabilities. &nbsp;The exercise planning team was composed of various state police specialties and members of the state exercise support tem. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Based on the exercise planning team&rsquo;s deliberations, the following objectives were developed for the Monster of Rock series:</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .5in;">
      	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate the organization&rsquo;s ability to evacuate the PNC Bank Arts Center.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .5in;">
      	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate the evacuation plans and procedures of the PNC Bank Arts Center.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .5in;">
      	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate the organization&rsquo;s interface and coordination with State and local emergency response elements.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .5in;">
      	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assess vehicular ingress (essential personnel) and egress (evacuation routes and hazard areas) during and following an evacuation.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .5in;">
      	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exercise the use of the Incident Command System (ICS) and Unified Command (UC) in response to a major emergency at PNC Bank Arts Center.</p>
      <p>
      	The purpose of the <strong>Monster of Rock</strong> Series is to provide officials and key personnel an opportunity to evaluate response and evacuation concepts, policies, plans, procedures, and capabilities to an IED at an entertainment venue. The intent is to provide an opportunity to refine overall response and decision-making processes as well as integration and coordination among the various NJSP field and specialty units, on site agencies and potentially local response agencies.</p>

      <p>
      	The Monster of Rock TTX focused on a mass evacuation effort after the discovery of an explosive device in the PNC Bank Arts Center. The exercise focused on the overall response and decision-making process, integration and coordination with responding NJSP units and the PNC Bank Arts Center. It was not a test of detailed response procedures.</p>
      <p>
      	The Monster of Rock TTX was a multimedia-driven and facilitated. The exercise was presented in two distinct phases, or modules, representing significant periods in the response.&nbsp; The modules for Monster of Rock are:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: .5in;">
      	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Module 1: IED Detection &amp; Response</p>
      <p style="margin-left: .5in;">
      	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Module 2: Evacuation</p>
      <p>
      	Each module began with a multimedia update, summarizing the key events occurring within that period of time. Following the updates, participants reviewed the situation and engaged in a group discussion of appropriate response issues.</p>
      <p>
      	Following each situation update, participants had an opportunity to review questions and discuss key issues.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The Monster of Rock FNE focused on the communication processes from initial detection of IED to notification of response units. The exercise was used to verify expected response times for the specialty units.</p>

      	EVENT DESCRIPTION<br />
      	<br />
      	March 12-15, 2010 a slow moving low pressure system stalled off the coast of New Jersey and caused large accumulations of rain in the area.. This event was a Nor&rsquo;Easter type storm slowly moving up the coast for a period of three days.&nbsp; The heavy rains along with the strong winds caused substantial damage in the State.&nbsp; Flooding occurred at a number of rivers throughout the state which caused evacuations and&nbsp; eventual sheltering of residents.&nbsp; Due to the strong winds, substantial power outages occurred. The NJROIC operational level increased to Level 3 at 1800 hours on 3-12-10 to monitor the storm and response efforts.&nbsp; NJOEM provided two staff members per shift for the duration of the event which terminated on 3-19-2010 at 1800 hours.&nbsp; State agencies present in the SEOC were the following: NJDEP, NJDOT, NJDCA,&nbsp; NJBPU and NJDMAVA.&nbsp; The following report represents a synopsis of events that occurred during this activation.<br />
      	<br />
      	Atlantic City had a 700 foot crane operating at the Revel Casino construction site become unstable which forced evacuations to occur in the surrounding area.&nbsp; NJTF1 was mobilized and enroute to the location to render assistance.&nbsp; Eventually, the Tishman construction crew working at the site was able to stabilize the crane and NJTF1 was cancelled.&nbsp; The American Red Cross sheltered 59 people from the surrounding condominiums at the Atlantic City Convention Center until the crane was stabilized.<br />
      	<br />
      	Throughout the rain event flooding became a major issue throughout the state at a number of our rivers; specifically the Passaic, Raritan, Rockaway, Pequannock, Pompton and Millstone.&nbsp; Flooding at these rivers caused evacuations of residents and the eventual sheltering of same.&nbsp; The high winds, coupled with the saturated soil caused trees to be uprooted and power lines to go down.&nbsp; Power outages throughout the state became a major problem which also contributed to the sheltering of populations.&nbsp; The power outages resulted in several water treatment facilities losing power and issuing water restrictions to customers. Governor Christie eventually Declared a State of Emergency on March 14, 2010 due to the extensive flooding and displaced populations.&nbsp; The following list encapsulates some of the major issues of this event as they relate to populations:<br />
      	<br />
      	Power Outages - At one point during this event 237,943 customers were without power in the State of New Jersey.&nbsp; This number represents the highest number we reached and was broken down by the following power companies: PSEG, JCPL, Orange/Rockland and Atlantic City Electric.<br />
      	<br />
      	Evacuations - Nearly 3,000 people were evacuated from their homes as a result of flooding.<br />
      	<br />
      	Shelters: (American Red Cross staffed shelters)<br />
      	Essex County - Fairfield (1)<br />
      	Morris County - Lincoln park (1)<br />
      	Passaic County - Little Falls, Paterson, Pompton Lakes (3)<br />
      	Somerset County - Manville, Bound Brook, Raritan Valley Community College (4)<br />
      	Total Sheltered - Approximately 600 &nbsp;<br />
      	<br />
      	Water Advisory/ Restrictions<br />

      	<font>The State of North Carolina has developed this Multi-Hazard Exercise / Evaluation and </font><font>Corrective Action Program Plan (MEECAP) to comply with HSEEP and provide </font><font>complementary guidance on the planning, conduct, and evaluation of multi-hazard </font><font>exercises. An attempt has been made to build upon the processes, terminology, and </font><font>concepts that North Carolina has used previously in other programs, such as the </font><font>Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) and Radiological Exercise Programs, to more rapidly </font><font>facilitate the transition to and enhance the understanding of this new evaluation approach.</font></p>
      <p align="left">
      	<font>The North Carolina Division of Emergency Management (NCEM) recognized the need to </font><font>develop a plan that integrates the HSEEP methodology in State, tribal and local </font><font>organizations and provides complementary guidance on the planning, conduct, evaluation </font><font>of, and improvement planning from corrective actions as a result of multi-hazard </font><font>exercises or &ldquo;real world&rdquo; incidents.</font></p>

      	Issue #1: <u>Staffing to Maintain 17 State Response Plans</u>. North Carolina has 17 state emergency response plans.&nbsp; Earlier in the last decade there were 5 of them.&nbsp; During this period, staffing decreased 40 percent making plan maintenance more cursory.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Issue #2: <u>Staffing to Plan <u>Exercises for</u> 17 State Response Plans</u>. Some plans (Hurricane) &nbsp;are exercised annually, one plan (REP)&nbsp;is exercised&nbsp;twice per year and&nbsp;most others less frequently.&nbsp; As an example of the latter, it is unknown when two food emergency plans were last exercised among state partners.&nbsp; There are only two exercise planning positions which&nbsp;are&nbsp;insufficient to&nbsp;support&nbsp;the exercise and testing of 17 response plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;See uploaded document, &quot;North Carolina Emergency Response Plans&quot;, March 2011 for list of state plans, lead planner, and when last used.</p>
      <p>
      	Issue #3: <u>State Response Planning Policy</u>.&nbsp; North Carolina&nbsp;needs to establish a policy specifying&nbsp;what constitutes a state response plan -- its format, what agency administers these plans for the state, content, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no policy, then&nbsp;some agencies may author their own joint-agency plans without sufficient coordination among tasked organizations.&nbsp;</p>

    - "Minor updates are done annually.  NCDEM plans to establish a direct relationship between exercising a plan and re-writing it.  Unfortunately, because insufficient staffing, 17 state response plans cannot be exercised with sufficient frequency.  Therefore, planning updates are necessarily cursory.  Also, North Carolina needs to transition to a deliberate planning process, and planners and stakeholders need training before doing so.  FEMA Rergion 4 has a planning course that may meet this need, but response to requests have been slow.   "

      	<font>The National Planning Scenarios and the establishment of the National Priorities steered </font><font>the focus of homeland security toward a capabilities-based planning approach. </font><font>Capabilities-based planning focuses on uncertainty. Because it can never be determined </font><font>with 100 percent accuracy what threat or hazard will occur, it is important to build </font><font>capabilities that can be applied to a wide variety of incidents. The TCL defines </font><font>capabilities-based planning as &ldquo;planning, under uncertainty, to build capabilities suitable </font><font>for a wide range of threats and hazards while working within an economic framework </font><font>that necessitates prioritization and choice.&rdquo; As such, capabilities-based planning is all-hazards </font><font>planning that identifies a baseline assessment of State or Urban Area homeland </font><font>security efforts. An assessment of this kind is necessary to begin any long-term exercise </font><font>strategy. This determines where current capabilities stand against the UTL and TCL and </font><font>identifies gaps in capabilities. The approach focuses efforts on identifying and developing </font><font>the capabilities from the TCL to perform the critical tasks from the UTL. The TCL </font><font>currently contains 37 target capabilities on which jurisdictions should focus their efforts.</font></p>

      	<p style="margin-left: 1.0in;">
      		SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approval and Written Notification of Emergency Management Exercises and Actual Occurrences</p>
      	<p>
      		Emergency management exercises are an effective means to assess planning and training programs, develop and sustain public/private interest and awareness of emergency management programs, and improve preparedness initiatives for all hazards that could potentially threaten our state, its citizens, the environment and property.&nbsp; Exercises are therefore, vitally important, functionally invaluable and encouraged for all levels of government and the private sector.</p>
      	<p>
      		In conjunction with this philosophy, all exercise activities must also be coordinated through and pre-announced to the state, the county and any affected municipalities.&nbsp; For obvious reasons and to ensure the safety of the potentially affected population, governing bodies must be aware of the activities in advance so that they can properly inform any concerned parties (surrounding communities, media, etc.) that the activities are of an exercise nature and that there is no need to be alarmed.</p>
      	<p>
      		Any entity (municipal, county, private organization, etc.) in this state, wishing to conduct and receive credit and recognition for any emergency management or homeland security type exercise activity (orientation, drill, tabletop, functional or full scale) or seek exercise credit for an actual occurrence, must submit their request through the appropriate county office of emergency management utilizing the newly developed State Exercise Tracking and Reporting System.&nbsp; Requests to conduct exercises shall be forwarded by the county office of emergency management and to the respective New Jersey Office of Emergency Management Regional Office at least thirty days prior to the anticipated start date of the activity.&nbsp; Requests to receive credit for exercises and/or actual occurrences will be forwarded in the same manner, no later than thirty days after termination of the activity.&nbsp; Utilization of this resource will prove invaluable to New Jersey&rsquo;s homeland security and emergency/disaster preparedness efforts by providing the ability to record, track, collate and compare, all statistical data pertaining to these activities throughout the state.&nbsp; Failure to comply with this Directive will result in a denial to conduct and/or receive credit for the activity and therefore all efforts commensurate with that activity shall go unrecognized.</p>

      		It shall be incumbent upon the counties of this state to ensure that every municipality within their respective jurisdiction is familiar with and adheres to this Directive.&nbsp; All notifications, including but not limited to, requests to conduct an exercise and requests for credit after the completion of an exercise or an actual occurrence, shall follow this process utilizing the State Exercise Tracking and Reporting System.&nbsp; If a municipality or other entity submits exercise or actual occurrence documentation to a county office of emergency management by means contrary to the utilization of this system, it shall become the responsibility of that county office of emergency management to transcribe the activity data into the State Exercise Tracking and Reporting System, prior to forwarding documentation to the appropriate Regional Office.</p>
      	<p>
      		Approval to conduct an exercise, grant credit for conducting an exercise or grant credit for an actual occurrence, shall be electronically transmitted to the requesting entity by the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management Regional Office.&nbsp; This shall be accomplished through the utilization of the State Exercise Tracking and Reporting System, within ten days of receipt by the Regional Office.&nbsp; It is recommended that the responsible county agent submit all requests to not only their respective Regional Field Representative but also to the Regional Office Supervisor and appropriate clerical staff, in order to ensure that multiple parties are aware of the request(s).</p>
      	<p>
      		The State Office of Emergency Management through the State Exercise Officer will be responsible for administratively coordinating all exercises sponsored, supported and/or conducted for departments and agencies of state government.&nbsp; This responsibility will also extend to the various business and industry sectors of our state, to include institutions of higher education.&nbsp; All pertinent reports associated with the State Exercise Tracking and Reporting System for these entities, shall be the responsibility of the State Exercise Officer or his/her designee.</p>
      	<p>
      		Emergency management programs at all levels of government are expected to encourage regular and comprehensive exercise participation by private sector entities that exist in their respective jurisdictions.&nbsp; Those private businesses and industries, school systems, not-for-profit agencies and volunteer organizations that elect to sponsor and/or conduct drills or any other exercise activity, should be routinely advised of the importance of doing so in coordination with their public sector partners, county and municipal offices of emergency, and other support organizations.&nbsp; By following this protocol, county and municipal governments can provide assistance to these entities and monitor their activities through the utilization of the State Exercise Tracking and Reporting System.&nbsp;</p>

      	The State of New Jersey adheres to the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) which delineates the following actions to be taken for exercises:</p>
      <p>
      	1. Conduct an annual Training and Exercise Planning Workshop (TEPW), and maintain a Multiyear Training<br />
      	and Exercise Plan (TEP). An annual TEPW provides an opportunity to develop, review, or update an entity&rsquo;s<br />
      	Multiyear TEP. The TEPW also provides a forum for determining how an entity will execute its multiyear plan in a<br />
      	given year. The purpose of the TEPW and the Multiyear TEP is to translate strategic goals and priorities into specific<br />
      	training and exercise activities and to coordinate and deconflict all training and exercise activities on a schedule.<br />
      	While all exercises conducted by an entity are not required to be included in its Multiyear TEP, the entity should<br />
      	follow the guidance and priorities established during its TEPW.</p>
      <p>
      	<br />
      	2. Plan and conduct exercises in accordance with the guidelines set forth in HSEEP policy. HSEEP policy guidance<br />
      	includes an overview of exercise planning and conduct. Specific areas for compliance include the use of various types<br />
      	of planning conferences and exercise documentation. The number of conferences and types of documentation required<br />
      	are flexible and depend on the full scope of the exercise being completed. HSEEP also provides sample documents for<br />
      	all potential presentations and manuals for all types of exercises.</p>
      <p>
      	<br />
      	3. Develop and submit a properly formatted After Action Report/Improvement Plan (AAR/IP). An AAR/IP is<br />
      	used to capture events as they occurred during an exercise, provide analysis of the events relative to exercise<br />
      	objectives, and suggest development actions to either further enhance or improve agencies&rsquo; planning and response<br />
      	capabilities. It also evaluates achievement of the selected exercise objectives and demonstration of the overall<br />
      	capabilities being validated. The IP portion of the AAR/IP includes corrective actions for improvement, along with<br />
      	timelines for their implementation and assignment to responsible parties.</p>
      <p>
      	<br />
      	4. Track and implement corrective actions identified in the AAR/IP. Once recommendations, corrective actions,<br />
      	responsibilities, and due dates are identified in the IP, the exercising entity ensures that each corrective action is<br />
      	tracked to completion. Exercising entities review all exercise evaluation feedback and resulting IPs to assess progress<br />
      	on enhancing preparedness. This analysis and information are incorporated into the capabilities-based planning<br />
      	process because they may identify needs for additional equipment, training, exercises, coordination, plans, or<br />
      	procedures that can be validated through future exercises. Continual IP tracking and implementation should be part of<br />
      	a corrective action program within each participating entity.</p>

      	<strong>Corrective Action Procedure</strong></p>
      <p>
      	1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Introduction</u></p>
      <p style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	The State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) activations are managed by the Preparedness Squad within the Recovery Bureau of the Emergency Management Section, New Jersey State Office of Emergency Management (NJOEM).</p>
      <p style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	A corrective action process has been developed to address lessons learned during SEOC activations.&nbsp; The primary catalyst for the detection of areas for operational and procedural improvement is the After Action Report (AAR) required for all SEOC activations.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	Once procedural or operational deficiencies are noted, an Improvement Plan (IP) is developed by the Preparedness Squad staff to; identify specific procedural elements to be addressed, the assignment of responsibility for procedural update, and assign a target date for completion.&nbsp; An on-going status reporting of this effort will be made at each Management Accountability Conference (MAC) until resolved.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	Important to any successful corrective action process is a training and exercise program focused on specific deficiencies or areas for improvement identified in After Action Reports. Training and exercises provided by qualified individuals is also integrated with procedural development and enhancements. Lessons learned during training and exercises may also be incorporated in procedural updates.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	Finally, a records retention program has been established in the form of a formal filing system for SEOC activation documents.&nbsp; The merger of improvement plans taken with respect to written AARs provides a verifiable historical audit trail of how deficiencies are resolved via lessons learned through targeted training and exercising.</p>
      <p>
      	2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>SEOC Physical Document Filing</u></p>
      <p style="margin-left: .75in;">
      	a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once an SEOC activation commences, the Operations Chief or his designee will prepare filing folders for the following documents:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 1.25in;">

      <p style="margin-left: .75in;">
      	b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon termination of an SEOC activation, the Operations Chief for the final operations period will place the SEOC Sign-In sheet folder, Incident Action Report folder, Situation Report folder and other event specific folders in a hanging Pendaflex folder with a tab labeled with the Event Date (MM/DD/YY).&nbsp; The Pendaflex folder will then be placed in the &ldquo;SEOC Event Files&rdquo; cabinet located in Room 134.</p>

      <p>
      	&nbsp;<strong>Interview on the Tracking&nbsp;of Event&nbsp;Corrective Action Status</strong></p>
      <p>
      	Ed Jenkins, Deputy Policy Chief; and Elaine Wathen, Assistant Director Information &amp; Planning</p>
      <p>
      	by ESR Reviewers:&nbsp; Mark Howard &amp; Cathi Slaminski &nbsp;(<em>Thursday</em>, <em>March 31, 2010 @ ~3:30 pm</em>)</p>
      <p>
      	<u>For Exercises</u>:&nbsp; Ms. Carolyn Freitag is the only State Exercise Officer for NCDEM&nbsp;for now (trying to hire 2 more) that oversees the exercise program and tracks corrective action status.&nbsp; Exercises are primarily tracked&nbsp;by utilizing HSEEP tools &amp; products (including the CAP System).&nbsp; Other agencies are responsible for making their own changes according to the corrective actions (CA) that apply to them, and the tracking thereof; however, most utilize the HSEEP tools, which NCDEM has access to and can observe other&rsquo;s CA progress and status (others&rsquo; progress also tends to be tied with grant funding).&nbsp; For Real-World Events (RWE), NCDEM does not have a management tool to track CA status -- of others and themselves.&nbsp; NCDEM is only beginning to implement tracking of RWE corrective actions for NCDEM via their online <em>SharePoint Task Site </em>tool, which basically captures the same data as CAPS&nbsp; (see Mark Howard&rsquo;s interview write-up for additional information).&nbsp; Currently, the only RWEs on the <em>SharePoint Task Site </em>are:&nbsp; Hurricane Earl and Remnants of Tropical Storm Nicole.</p>
      <p>
      	Interview confirmed information in the NCDEM <em>T&amp;E Policy</em> that the Director of NCEM holds monthly meetings with Division management and supervisors to assign, track and assess completion of Corrective Actions identified in AARs of exercises and Real-World Events (RWE) within the division.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;The interviewees noted that there are multiple data systems (HSEEP, etc) out there that have Ex &amp; RWE information that is not shared by other data systems.&nbsp; To have these systems talk with another and share this information would be a HUGE help and would remove redundant work, like data entering.&nbsp;</p>

      	<strong>Interview for Real World/Exercise Events</strong></p>
      <p align="center">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Interview with:</p>
      <p>
      	March 31, 2011</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;Ed Jenkins, Deputy Plans Chief&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Elaine Wathen Asst. Director Information and Planning</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	On March 31, 2011, Cathi Slaminski and I from EMAP conducted an interview with Mr. Ed Jenkins and Elaine Wathen from the North Carolina Emergency Management Division.&nbsp; We asked Mr. Jenkins if he could provide us with a description of the process that is currently used for real world events as well as exercises that have identified corrective actions associated with an After Action Report.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Mr. Jenkins advised that they currently hold a hot wash after each event and or exercise.&nbsp; During that hot wash, the participants are able to provide information both good and bad concerning how the event or exercise was handled.&nbsp; During this hot wash, someone will record the responses and then an After Action Report is completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within this report, there will be identified corrective actions with specific assignments to agencies or individuals as well as due/completion dates.</p>
      <p>
      	Mr. Jenkins stated that each state agency handles their own corrective actions and the NCDEM deals with theirs.&nbsp; The division will make the necessary corrections identified however currently there is not a system or process in place for tracking those corrective actions assigned to other state or local agencies.&nbsp; That is a process that they hope to achieve soon.</p>
      <p>
      	Mr. Jenkins related that he has begun to utilize a Share Point system for recording the corrective actions from events and exercises and placing them in a management tool to track the progress and status of those corrective actions.&nbsp; Currently there are two events in the system.&nbsp; Currently there is no one assigned specifically to follow up on the progress however Mr. Jenkins did advise that a new employee will start on Monday the 4<sup>th</sup> who will have the responsibility of overseeing the process.&nbsp; Mr. Jenkins further related that currently they have monthly division meetings and any outstanding issues that were assigned to another division are discussed to determine progress.&nbsp; In addition, there are weekly in house meetings to cover the progress of the corrective actions.&nbsp; Mr. Jenkins advised that on the last Monday of the month, they do meet to review the strategic plan and what is due.</p>
      <h2>
      	During a review of the NCEM Exercise &amp; Corrective Action Program Plan April 18, 2008 this reviewer found a paragraph that confirmed what Mr. Jenkins had related.&nbsp; It stated the following;</h2>
      <p>
      	The Director of NCEM will hold monthly meetings with Division Management and Supervisors to assign, track, and assess completion of</p>
      <p>
      	Corrective Actions identified in AARs of exercises and &ldquo;real-world.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>
      	Mr. Jenkins as well as Elaine Wathen confirmed that they do have some work to do with regards to tracking and confirming completion of any corrective action from an event or exercise.&nbsp; Both did advise that they are working at improving this situation.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	This concluded the interview.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	It is apparent that the program does in fact have processes in place to create After Action Reports/IP and to create Corrective Action Items for issues relating to real world and exercise events.&nbsp; There is a process to assign the corrective actions to the appropriate branch or division and through the use of the CAP system, they do track those events.&nbsp; However the program has admitted at the beginning of the review process that they have not followed up very well on whether the CA&rsquo;s have in fact been completed within their own organization and especially for other state agencies.&nbsp; There hope is that with the addition of the new employee that will be responsible for this follow up that this situation can be corrected.&nbsp; In addition with the use of the Share Point System and the weekly and monthly meetings, the program should be able to resolve the current situation.</p>

      	Elenka Jarolimek and Luke Meyers interviewed Patricia Williams, Emergency Management Planner, City and County of Denver. Pat was hired two months before the assessment, and therefore unable to discuss the methodology or data sources used to conduct the hazard analysis. She provided the following document for further review that may meet compliance, although CCD Hazard Analysis does not reference them as sources:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>

      	Philip McCormick interviewed Matt Mueller, Accreditation Manager and Ted Witowski, USAI Training and Exercise Coordinator in Mr. Witowski&rsquo;s office. They described the exercise process as a joint venture between the City/County of Denver, the NCR, and the Denver UASI. The City/County local program conducts exercises and training for OEHSM as well as Denver City/County staff as it primarily relates to activities in the EOC, Financial support for many of the exercises is provided by the UASI and NCR as needed. The Program sits as a stakeholder in the UASI and NCR training and exercise development and the UASI sits as a provider of training and coordinating of regional exercises. The UASI and the Program conduct independent and cooperative needs assessments with the Program identifying their exercise needs. The UASI and the NCR sponsors regional exercises that are often directly associated with the hazards identified in their Hazard Mitigation Plan and their needs assessment. The exercise needs of the Program are met through this cooperative effort.</p>

      	The 2007 EOP describes the Programs AAR process to identify, track, and resolve deficiencies identified after actual events, training, and exercises:</p>
      <p>
      	Following the City and County of Denver&rsquo;s response to emergencies and disasters, the Office of Emergency Management will coordinate the preparation of an After-Action Report (AAR) documenting the response and recovery activities, efforts and results. Within ten (10) workdays following the termination of&nbsp;an&nbsp;emergency&nbsp;or&nbsp;disaster incident, each department and agency involved in the response and recovery effort will provide to OEM an AAR outlining the agency&#39;s level of involvement, actions, results, successes and failures.</p>
      <p>
      	OEM will compile all department and agency submittals into a comprehensive AAR that documents a summary of response and recovery efforts, the results, and presents successes and recommendations for improvements. A copy of the AAR will be distributed to City and County executive management team, department and agency managers. The AAR will be serve as a valuable resource in building a database from which OEM can derive lessons learned and identify best practices to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Denver&rsquo;s emergency management preparedness, response and recovery programs.</p>

      <ol>
      	<li>
      		<u>Introduction</u></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      	The State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) activations are managed by the Preparedness Squad within the Recovery Bureau of the Emergency Management Section, New Jersey State Office of Emergency Management (NJOEM).</p>
      <p>
      	A corrective action process has been developed to address lessons learned during SEOC activations.&nbsp; The primary catalyst for the detection of areas for operational and procedural improvement is the After Action Report (AAR) required for all SEOC activations.</p>
      <p>
      	Once procedural or operational deficiencies are noted, an Improvement Plan (IP) is developed by the Preparedness Squad staff to; identify specific procedural elements to be addressed, the assignment of responsibility for procedural update, and assign a target date for completion.&nbsp; An on-going status reporting of this effort will be made at each Management Accountability Conference (MAC) until resolved.</p>
      <p>
      	Important to any successful corrective action process is a training and exercise program focused on specific deficiencies or areas for improvement identified in After Action Reports. Training and exercises provided by qualified individuals is also integrated with procedural development and enhancements. Lessons learned during training and exercises may also be incorporated in procedural updates.</p>
      <p>
      	Finally, a records retention program has been established in the form of a formal filing system for SEOC activation documents.&nbsp; The merger of improvement plans taken with respect to written AARs provides a verifiable historical audit trail of how deficiencies are resolved via lessons learned through targeted training and exercising.&nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>
      		<u>SEOC Physical Document Filing</u>
      		<ol>
      			<li>
      				Once an SEOC activation commences, the Operations Chief or his designee will prepare filing folders for the following documents:
      				<ol>
      					<li>
      						SEOC Sign-In / Attendance Sheets</li>
      					<li>
      						Incident Action Reports (IAPs)</li>
      					<li>
      						Situation Report (SITREPs)</li>
      					<li>
      						After Action Report (AARs)</li>
      					<li>
      						Other Event Specific Files i.e.,
      						<ul>
      							<li>
      								Weather related files</li>
      							<li>
      								Executive Orders and Emergency Declarations</li>
      						</ul>
      					</li>
      				</ol>
      			</li>

    - "COMMAND AND CONTROL Experienced Lieutenants and SEOC personnel were assigned to the SEOC for each Operational Period.  An additional person was also added to augment the usual two assigned during an SEOC activation. This ensured that knowledgeable people were on hand at all times to monitor the event and deploy resources where needed.  Incident Action Plans (IAP\xE2\x80\x99s) were completed and assigned to each operational period and were thoroughly briefed to the oncoming staff for that period. On each IAP specific mission objectives were identified and defined. Periodic briefings were conducted throughout the operational periods in order to coincide with the dissemination of the situation report.  The briefings provided the SEOC Commander a chance to brief all on the updated conditions for this event as well as provide all staff assigned a chance to provide input on their current status and operations.  All County OEM\xE2\x80\x99s monitored E-Team for this event but those that actually activated were: Passaic, Morris, Hunterdon, Essex and Mercer.  "

Periodic briefings were conducted by the SEOC Commander to coincide with the dissemination of the situation report every four hours.

The NJ Department of Human Services, working along with the Salvation Army and Red Cross, were able to provide updated information on feeding and sheltering operations ongoing throughout the state.  The NJ Department of Human Services needs to have the Red Cross review their accounting procedures for capturing number of individuals being sheltered.  The sheltering population is of critical importance to the SEOC and we should not have to rely on our regional Troopers to obtain this information when the Red Cross should have the updated numbers available at a moments notice and not during a limited time period throughout the day.  Mr. William Schaffer, NJ Dept. Of Human Services, will work with the Red Cross to address this concern. "

Thomas Rafferty, GIS Coordinator, worked from home and at the SEOC in order to supply river gage information, thorough weather briefing packets, and outstanding maps that were utilized by Command in order to formulate additional mission objectives for each operation period. Lastly, our IT personnel were staffed throughout this event and during each operational period in order to quickly address any computer or eteam issues that arose.
